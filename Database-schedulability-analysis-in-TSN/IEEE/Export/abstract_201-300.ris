AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is expected to be a cornerstone in tomorrow's industrial networks. That is because of its ability to provide deterministic quality-of-service in terms of delay, jitter, and scalability. Moreover, it enables more scalable, more affordable, and easier to manage and operate networks compared to current industrial networks, which are based on Industrial Ethernet. In this article, we evaluate the maximum capacity of the asynchronous TSN networks to accommodate industrial traffic flows. To that end, we formally formulate the Flow Allocation Problem (FAP) in the mentioned networks as a convex mixed-integer non-linear program. To the best of the authors' knowledge, neither the maximum utilization of the asynchronous TSN networks nor the formulation of the FAP in those networks have been previously addressed in the literature. The results show that the network topology and the traffic matrix highly impact on the link utilization.

AB  - The IEEE Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) provides a scalable solution for real-time communication using Ethernet technology. In this paper, we address the availability of FPGA-based TSN under a harsh radiation environment. In particular, the impact of periodic repair mechanisms and the transmission redundancy on the communication availability is investigated. To achieve our goal, we propose a Timed Automata (TA) model of the TSN to capture the impact of periodic repair on communication reliability. As a result, the proposed analysis framework allows the designer to set up the appropriate repair cycle and redundancy level according to the application criticality and required system reliability. To demonstrate the proposed analysis framework, we consider a case study based on the switched network deployed in the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) American-European interplanetary spacecraft. Our analysis results show a specific optimal scrubbing rate for each radiation environment regardless the network utilization conditions.

AB  - Time-sensitive software-defined networking (TSSDN) is an emerging technology that combines the real-time network configuration capabilities of software-defined networking (SDN) with the deterministic flow delivery capabilities of time-sensitive networking (TSN), making it ideal for use in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, as data flows generated by industrial applications grow exponentially, it is challenging to achieve low-latency and reliable data flow transmission at the same time in TSSDN due to the limited network resources. To address this issue, we propose the adoption of the frame replication and elimination for reliability (FRER) mechanism in TSSDN-based IIoT systems. However, it is important to acknowledge that the FRER mechanism introduces stress on the already restricted network resources by generating redundant paths. In light of this concern, we construct an end-to-end delay bound model and a reliability model to analyze this issue. To mitigate the stress imposed on the network, we formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the overall system utility while adhering to the transmission requirements of business flows and the limitations of hardware resources. Consequently, we devise an algorithm for reliability-enhanced flow routing and scheduling, which effectively solves the aforementioned optimization problem. To validate the effectiveness and performance of our proposed algorithm, we conduct numerical simulations on four data sets. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing methods.

AB  - With the rapid increase of applications of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), supporting the rapid update and deployment of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) in dynamic scenarios has become a major challenge. However, most proposals focus on implementing offline generation of scheduling tables in TSN based on time-aware shapers (TAS), and are not suitable for automation scenarios such as network redeployment under frequent changes in devices, especially in complex networks. In order to maximize the resource efficiency of timeslots and ensure load balance, while reducing bandwidth waste to accommodate more schedulable flows, we designed a heuristic online incremental update algorithm (OIU) compatible with the TAS mechanism to deploy multicast flows. The evaluation results indicate that compared with existing work, the OIU algorithm has improved its operational efficiency by at least 20 times in high load flow scenarios. At the same time, its support of multicast has also improved load balancing on the link.

AB  - Emerging latency-sensitive applications (e.g., industrial control, in-vehicle networks) require that the networks guaranteed data delivery with low, bounded latency. To meet this requirement, the IEEE 802.1 Working Group developed the time-sensitive networks (TSN) standard to enable deterministic communication on standard Ethernet. TSN technology is developed to enable deterministic communication using traffic scheduling and shaping technology. However, while the TSN standards define the mechanisms to handle scheduled traffic, it does not specify algorithms to compute fine-grained traffic scheduling policy. Current TSN flow scheduling schemes largely rely on a manual process, requiring knowledge of the traffic pattern and network topology features. Inspired by recent successes in applying reinforcement learning in online control, we propose a deep reinforcement learning aided no-waiting flow scheduling algorithm in TSN. Extensive simulations are performed to verify that our algorithm can find the optimal solution in an acceptable time.

AB  - Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) has been extensively utilized to enable the transport of time-sensitive fronthaul flows in Ethernet-bridged networks. However, recently emerged ultra-low delay and jitter requirements of the TSN pose great challenges to Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) over Ethernet. Considering this, we propose a Deterministic Transmittable Time-Based Asynchronous Scheduler (DTT-BAS) in this paper. The DTT- BAS uses the deterministic transmittable timestamp as the core scheduling mechanism, which numerically compares the timestamps to optimize the flow scheduling in the network. For the fronthaul scenario, simulation results validate that the DTT-BAS achieves a high probability of zero jitter and reduces the influence of clock skews with a delay performance close to IEEE 802.1CM frame preemption algorithm.

Such a model is required as an input to perform end-to-end timing analysis of these systems. Furthermore, we present a methodology that aims at automated extraction of instances of the end-to-end timing model from component-based software architectures of the systems and the TSN network configurations. As a proof of concept, we implement the proposed end-to-end timing model and the extraction methodology in the Rubus Component Model (RCM) and its tool chain Rubus-ICE that are used in the vehicle industry. We demonstrate the usability of the proposed model and methodology by modeling a vehicular industrial use case and performing its timing analysis.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of standards that enables the industry to provide real-time guarantees for time-critical communications with Ethernet hardware. TSN supports various queuing and scheduling mechanisms and allows the integration of multiple traffic types in a single network. Network Calculus (NC) can be used to calculate upper bounds for latencies and buffer sizes within these networks, for example, for safety or real-time traffic. We explain the relevance of NC for TSN-based computer communications and potential areas of application. Different NC analysis approaches have been published to examine different parts of TSN and this paper provides a survey of these publications and presents their main results, dependencies, and differences. We present a consistent presentation of the most important results and suggest an improvement to model the output of sending end-devices. To ease access to the current research status, we introduce a common notation to show how all results depend on each other and also identify common assumptions. Thus, we offer a comprehensive overview of NC for industrial networks and identify possible areas for future work.

AB  - Time-sensitive networks (TSNs) support not only traditional best-effort communications but also deterministic communications, which send each packet at a deterministic time so that the data transmissions of networked control systems can be precisely scheduled to guarantee hard real-time constraints. No-wait scheduling is suitable for such TSNs and generates the schedules of deterministic communications with the minimal network resources so that all of the remaining resources can be used to improve the throughput of best-effort communications. However, due to inappropriate message fragmentation, the realtime performance of no-wait scheduling algorithms is reduced. Therefore, in this paper, joint algorithms of message fragmentation and no-wait scheduling are proposed. First, a specification for the joint problem based on optimization modulo theories is proposed so that off-the-shelf solvers can be used to find optimal solutions. Second, to improve the scalability of our algorithm, the worst-case delay of messages is analyzed, and then, based on the analysis, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to construct low-delay schedules. Finally, we conduct extensive test cases to evaluate our proposed algorithms. The evaluation results indicate that, compared to existing algorithms, the proposed joint algorithm improves schedulability by up to 50%.

AB  - The Industrial Internet of Things, Industry 4.0 and cloud computing are fundamentally transforming today's industrial networks towards high connectivity. At the same time, the number of cyber-attacks against industrial infrastructure increased drastically over the last years, requiring to tightly limit the connectivity between the networked devices of a plant. For both of these trends, there are mechanisms evolving and partially already in place. Network segmentation with packet filters is a key mechanism for achieving improved network security while Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a promising option to realize advanced real-time applications in future industrial networks. However, although being built based on widely accepted standards and despite their practical relevance, these two concepts don't play together well. In this paper, we analyze the problems that arise when TSN networks are segmented using today's firewalls and packet filters. In particular, we discuss and quantify the impact of delay and jitter caused by packet filters on TSN traffic. We also show that the delays and jitter introduced by CPU-based filtering can be prohibitively high in real-time scenarios. Based on our analysis, we present and compare three approaches to overcome the challenges created by the combination of these two major trends in industrial networks.

AB  - The rise of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has sparked a significant transformation in the domain of industrial networks. Concurrently, industrial networks have established new benchmarks for communication quality, characterized by stringent requirements for low latency, minimal jitter, and enhanced reliability. In this context, the TSN subcommittee under the IEEE 802.1 working group has released a comprehensive collection of protocol standards. These standards are intricately crafted to ensure deterministic low latency in inherently unpredictable Ethernet environments. To enhance deterministic Quality of Service (QoS) in industrial networks and increase the flexibility of network scheduling paradigms, emerging technologies that combine TSN with Software-Defined Networking (TSSDN) have gained significant attention. Nevertheless, due to the complex and multifaceted nature of factory workflows and the varying scheduling requirements at different hierarchical levels, current industrial scheduling methods encounter challenges in efficiently managing network traffic in real-world factory environments. In this paper, we present a systematic framework designed for the scheduling of factory traffic. Additionally, we introduce two distinct scheduling mechanisms, each based on a framework with relaxed constraints. These mechanisms correspond to intra-level and inter-level traffic transmission in industrial networks. According to our experimental results, we observe an increase of 12.6% to 25.32% in the relaxed constraint scheduling mechanism when compared to the single scheduling scheme, along with a 9% reduction in the proportion of occupied queues.

AB  - Many network applications, e.g., industrial control, demand ultra-low latency (ULL). However, traditional packet networks can only reduce the end-to-end latencies to the order of tens of milliseconds. The IEEE 802.1 time sensitive networking (TSN) standard and related research studies have sought to provide link layer support for ULL networking, while the emerging IETF deterministic networking (DetNet) standards seek to provide the complementary network layer ULL support. This paper provides an up-to-date comprehensive survey of the IEEE TSN and IETF DetNet standards and the related research studies. The survey of these standards and research studies is organized according to the main categories of flow concept, flow synchronization, flow management, flow control, and flow integrity. ULL networking mechanisms play a critical role in the emerging fifth generation (5G) network access chain from wireless devices via access, backhaul, and core networks. We survey the studies that specifically target the support of ULL in 5G networks, with the main categories of fronthaul, backhaul, and network management. Throughout, we identify the pitfalls and limitations of the existing standards and research studies. This survey can thus serve as a basis for the development of standards enhancements and future ULL research studies that address the identified pitfalls and limitations.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is appealing to Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) due to its support for deterministic real-time communication based on Ethernet. The deterministic transmission of time-sensitive traffic is achieved through a time-triggered mechanism, which requires precise schedule synthesis. However, existing approaches mostly focus on the static schedule, which cannot guarantee rapid response to dynamic requirements due to long runtime. Moreover, the multicast scheduling problem required for distributed applications in IIoT has been ignored. In this paper, we formulate the joint routing and scheduling problem for multicast time-sensitive traffic based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and extend it to cluster-ILP (CILP) to accelerate schedule synthesis. Firstly, an improved topology pruning is introduced to reduce the scale of the scheduling problem. Then flows are divided into several groups and schedules are calculated for flows in different groups incrementally. The evaluation results indicate that our proposed algorithm can reduce the runtime by 86.7% on average while ensuring the performance of resource utilization, thus increasing the schedulability for dynamic applications in TSN.

AB  - In order to solve the contradiction between data traffic growth and real-time control information in intelligent substation, this paper proposes a time-sensitive network (TSN)based intelligent substation switch traffic scheduling model, which uses new technologies to dispatch data link layer traffic. This technology adopts the idea of monopolizing and sharing the time slot window for traffic transmission time, using the mechanism of frame preemption in the traffic transmission channel, realizing traffic classification according to the traffic characteristics, and is used to improve the traffic scheduling mechanism of the process layer of the intelligent substation on the traditional switch, improve the effect of determining the time-sensitive traffic delay scheduling, provide traffic transmission services with low latency jitter for the Ethernet network of the intelligent substation, and put forward a new idea for the improvement of the service quality (QoS) of the power system.

AB  - With the development of new power systems, the problem of large delay and large jitter in the transmission of time-sensitive data streams in power systems has put forward higher network performance requirements. This paper proposes a time-sensitive network scheduling method for substation traffic transmission problem for substation service flow. The method starts from two aspects, path and scheduling, path this paper uses genetics algorithm to optimize on the basis of K shortest path, and scheduling this paper combines the content of bandwidth reservation technology in the TSN standard protocol to schedule the substation traffic and solves it by SMT modelling using Z3 solver. The experimental results compare the scheduling method proposed in this paper with the heuristic list scheduling algorithm (HLS) and greedy adaptive search algorithm (GRASP), in which the end-to-end delay of the traffic is reduced by about 15% and the packet loss rate is reduced by about 17%.

AB  - Ethernet is increasingly recognized as the future communication standard for distributed embedded systems in multiple domains such as industrial automation, automotive and avionics. A main motivation for this is cost and available data rate. A critical issue in the adoption of Ethernet in these domains is the timing of frame transfers, as many relevant applications require a guaranteed low-latency communication in order to meet real-time constraints. Ethernet AVB is an upcoming standard which addresses the timing issues by extending the existing strict-priority arbitration. Still, it needs to be evaluated whether these mechanism suffice for the targeted applications. For safety-critical applications, this can not only be done using intuition or simulation but requires a formal approach to assure the coverage of all worst-case corner cases. Hence, we present in this paper a formal worst-case analysis of the timing properties of Ethernet AVB and strict-priority Ethernet. This analysis mathematically determines safe upper bounds on the latency of frame transfers. Using this approach, we evaluate different topologies for a typical use-case in industrial automation.

AB  - As Ethernet rapidly replaces legacy networks as the core high-speed network in helicopter‚Äôs avionics and mission systems, we ask in this paper the question of the technical benefits of migrating to Ethernet Time-Sensitive-Networking (TSN). Indeed, TSN has become a rich toolbox of mechanisms and protocols to address Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements pertaining to timing and reliability. TSN is quickly becoming the prominent technology for wired high-speed communications in a variety of application domains like automotive, industry 4.0 and telecom. In this context, this work explores the use of TSN timing QoS mechanisms for helicopter‚Äôs avionics and mission systems on a case-study representative of the communication requirements of next-generation systems. This study aims to provide quantified insights into what can be expected from TSN in terms of timing, memory usage and extensibility.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) describes a set of features extending the functionalities and Quality of Service (QoS) of standard Ethernet to enable determinism, reliability and reconfigurability, key requirements for Industry 4.0. The TSN profile for industrial automation (IEC/IEEE 60802 standard) defines specific options to favor reliability and reconfigurability. Nevertheless, there are multiple possible options for scheduling to guarantee determinism. Today, the scheduling standards in TSN can be categorized according to the implemented communication paradigm: asynchronous or synchronous. This paradigm is of utmost importance to quantify the synchronization need and the reconfigurability effort. The main contribution of this work is the specification of an asynchronous TSN-compliant network for Industry 4.0, FactoRing, that bridges the gap between both paradigms to guarantee low bounded jitters and latencies, without the need of synchronization and complex network planning. Moreover, FactoRing supports ring-based topologies to significantly reduce installation wiring and costs. In this paper, we first present the main industry 4.0 requirements and assess the ability of recommended TSN mechanisms for industrial automation versus such requirements. Afterwards, we detail the main features of Factoring including QoS, reliability and reconfiguration management. Finally, preliminary results on performance metrics like jitters, latencies and buffer usage are discussed and the first conclusions on the promises of Factoring to meet Industry 4.0 requirements are derived.

AB  - Owing to Ethernet's low cost, high bandwidth and architecture openness, much attention has been paid to develop converged Ethernet to support both time-critical services and conventional communication services on a unified network infrastructure. The greatest challenge here is providing low and deterministic latency for time-critical packets. Recently, the IEEE time sensitive networking task group is launched to address it. However, their framework is complex and unsuitable for commodity switch architecture. In this paper, we propose a concise and efficient converged real-time Ethernet framework called XpressEth, which leverages Dual Preemption mechanism to minimize the delay of time-critical packets, and employs a lightweight Slot Assignment Scheduler to minimize the conflicts among time-critical packets at sources. XpressEth cuts off great burden from both forwarding and scheduling. The simulation results verify that XpressEth can provide ultra-low and deterministic latency for time-critical packets (1.024Œº s per hop and zero jitter in 1Gbps network), which is 13√ó better than time sensitive networking solution, and the side-effect on conventional communication traffic is negligible.

AB  - In the era of the Internet of Everything, the burst of traffic will bring many problems. Traffic shaping, as a common means to limit burst traffic rate, achieves ‚Äúpeak and valley reduction‚Äù to smooth the output rate, avoid network congestion, guarantee the quality of service (QoS) and improve the overall network transmission efficiency. This paper first explains the basic concept of traffic shaping, the related algorithms in traffic shaping, and compares the differences between traffic shaping and traffic policing. It then describes the research on traffic shaping in software-defined networks and the results from the combination of the two. This is followed by an introduction to relatively new technology for industry, time-sensitive networks, and an exploration of the functions of various types of traffic shapers in time-sensitive networks. This is followed by a description of case studies of traffic shaping in IoT scenarios and an overview of these traffic shaping schemes, summarizing the usefulness of the shaping schemes. Finally, the future of traffic shaping is explored.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking is a promising technology that supports deterministic services with bounded delay, low packet delay variation, and low packet loss. Time-Sensitive Networking consists of several components, in which traffic scheduling plays an important role to provide the delay guarantee. The traffic scheduling on the level of flow is challenging for dense traffic demands. In this paper, we propose a time-aware traffic scheduling scheme based on network virtualization to schedule a large number of flows. In the scheme, the physical queues of a network node are abstracted as virtual queues, which isolate each flow with a time offset parameter. A scheduling algorithm is designed into two stages of virtual queues mapping and schedule computation. The simulation results in a use case of industrial automation show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is an emerging solution for deterministic transmission of time-sensitive services in wired/Ethernet and wireless networks and is considered to be the next generation of Ethernet. Due to the dynamic nature in its physical layer, wireless communications in general and wireless TSN (WTSN) in particular face more technical challenges than wired transmission. This paper proposes a wireless dynamic flow scheduling algorithm that is coined as PA-WTSN and deals with joint power and resource allocation based on OFDMA channel access. The algorithm is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem with time sensitivity constraints and consideration of power allocation which is necessary for time-varying wireless channels. With the proposed algorithm, the end-to-end delay is optimized. and the effectiveness of the algorithm is validated by simulation.

AB  - This paper proposes a new paradigm for control plane in Time Sensitive Networks (TSN). An SDN controller proactively instructs network elements on the reconfigurations to perform locally if some specific events occur (e.g., failures, performance degradations). Instructions are given in the form of Finite State Machines (FSMs), which store information related to the actions that each network element should execute to react against a specific event. Thus, if such event occurs, the SDN controller is by-passed reducing reaction (e.g., recovery) time. Such an approach is here implemented for recovery upon failures in TSN. Experiments of failure recovery are carried out and measurements are presented comparing the FSM-based solution with a fully-centralized reactive restoration. Moreover, the proposed approach is compared through simulations against Frame Replication and Elimination for Reliability. Results will show how proactive FSM manipulation can strongly reduce recovery time in SDN-based TSN networks without overloading the network with frame replicas.

AB  - In this work authors present a Traffic Shaping Engine (TSE) intended for the next generation of Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) compliant Network/System on Chip (NoC/SoC) devices, targeting especially the automotive industry. The TSE provides a new layer of abstraction that allows to integrate all the TSN standards related to traffic shaping that are applicable to In-Vehicle Networks (IVNs) according to IEEE P802.1DG, providing a common interface for the management of the shapers, independently of the TSN algorithms in place. The TSE provides a Hardware (HW) architecture that solves the traffic shaping processing and adaptation to network status (load balancing) fully autonomously, without intervention from the CPU. The TSE is designed as a coarse-grain configurable HW co-processor or HW Accelerator (HWA) that can be attached to the system CPU, which follows a Software Defined Networking approach. It provides the right interface and set of parameters to handle all the required traffic shaping algorithms in a common and centralized manner in the control plane, while keeping a common data plane regardless of the traffic shaping processing required. The proposed strategy allows to minimize latency and maximize throughput and Quality of Service, contributing towards future automotive Gateway solutions for IVNs with stringent real-time routing and tunneling constraints.

AB  - Distributed mixed-criticality system (DMCS) has been widely used in various critical domains such as self-driving cars and space crafts. To guarantee the end-to-end QoS (i.e., deadline/jitter requirements) of sensing-controlling-actuating control loops (CL) applications, DMCS adopts Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), an emerging real-time Ethernet technology, for communication between end systems (ES). TSN provides a synchronized global clock and guarantees bounded delay for time-critical traffic in CLs, making it possible for DMCS to collaboratively schedule the computation (on ES) and communication (in TSN) to meet the Quality of Service (QoS) requirement. However, as modern DMCS tends to use fully-fledged Linux distributions (rather than a custom real-time OS) on ES to enjoy Linux‚Äôs mature ecosystem, it is challenging for DMCS to realize TSN-based QoS guarantees because the event-triggered scheduling of Linux on ES is incompatible with TSN.This paper proposes TAsk Scheduling Puppeteer (TASP), a mechanism that schedules CL tasks based on TSN without modifying the Linux OS. The key idea of TASP is to manipulate task scheduling by controlling the timing of CL packet submissions at the interface between TSN and ES. Specifically, TASP extracts two parameters: Fore Guardband (ForeGB) and Back Guardband (BackGB). During the ForeGB period before a CL packet‚Äôs submission, TASP forbids any packets‚Äô submission; while during the BackGB period after a CL packet‚Äôs submission, TASP forbids any other CL packets‚Äô submission. ForeGB and BackGB can ensure that there is at most one schedulable task on the ES at any time, and thus Linux has no choice but to schedule the only task, making the Linux scheduler a puppet. We have deployed TASP and evaluated it in real-world TSN switches based on an open-source TSN project, OpenTSN. The TASP-enabled ES can achieve task scheduling precisely based on TSN‚Äôs global clock, which outperforms the original ES by reducing end-to-end jitter from milliseconds to microseconds.

AB  - Ethernet is nowadays a promising communication technology for automotive applications as, comparing with the existing in-vehicle networks, it offers high bandwidth and a significant reduction of cabling costs, while meeting the EMC/EMI requirements of automotive communications. The IEEE 802.1Q standard is one of the base standards of Time-Sensitive Networking. It offers several benefits, such as the real-time support, as it provides bounded latency to time-constrained traffic classes, with zero jitter and congestion-free transmissions, and the capability to handle multiple traffic classes on the same channel. The IEEE 802.1Q standard specifies multiple features, that support different ways to handle the transmission of Ethernet frames. In this paper a comparative performance assessment of three network configurations defined in the IEEE 802.1Q standard for automotive applications are presented. The assessment results are obtained using the OMNeT++ framework. The comparison between the results of these three different network configurations, using realistic traffic patterns, provides a quantitative evaluation of the network performance in terms of maximum end-to-end delays and absolute jitter.

AB  - As the requirements of real-time networking increase, the IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group is working on new standards for high bandwidth and low latency Ethernet switching. In particular, the upcoming P802.1Qcr standard features Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS), which is a promising approach for real-time networks with high dynamics and critical safety requirements. Additionally, parallel concepts such as frame preemption can be used to reduce delays even further. This work presents a discrete event simulation framework that can analyze the performance of these concepts. It implements frame preemption and multiple shaping algorithms, while recording latency and queue utilization statistics at the switches. In addition, an evaluation of a linear topology with four switches is performed under high link utilization, which demonstrates the benefit of the above mechanisms compared to regular Ethernet switching.

AB  - To extend industrial Ethernet to guarantee real-time quality-of-service (QoS), the IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group has been developing a series of specifications, including the flow control series, of which Credit-Based Shaping (CBS) and Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) were defined in IEEE 802.1 Qav standard and IEEE 802.1 Qcr draft respectively. While CBS is a per-class scheduling strategy, ATS is a per-flow scheduling. To analyze performance of these flow control strategies, comparison among CBS, ATS and Strict Priority Queuing (SPQ) is performed using a suite of self-developed models. Models were implemented and operated in the OMNeT++ simulation platform. Moreover, CBS and ATS are implied in different network load. And the results show that ATS flow control strategy can provide better real time performance guarantee for aperiodic traffics than CBS in heavy network load.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Deterministic Networking (DetNet) technologies are increasingly recognized as key levers of the future 5G transport networks (TNs) due to their capabilities for providing deterministic Quality-of-Service and enabling the coexistence of critical and best-effort services. Additionally, they rely on programmable and cost-effective Ethernet-based forwarding planes. This article addresses the flow allocation problem in 5G backhaul networks realized as asynchronous TSN networks, whose building block is the Asynchronous Traffic Shaper. We propose an offline solution, dubbed ‚ÄúNext Generation Transport Network Optimizer‚Äù (NEPTUNO), that combines exact optimization methods and heuristic techniques and leverages data analytics to solve the flow allocation problem. NEPTUNO aims to maximize the flow acceptance ratio while guaranteeing the deterministic Quality-of-Service requirements of the critical flows. We carried out a performance evaluation of NEPTUNO regarding the degree of optimality, execution time, and flow rejection ratio. Furthermore, we compare NEPTUNO with a novel online baseline solution for two different optimization goals. Online methods compute the flow's allocation configuration right after the flow arrives at the network, whereas offline solutions like NEPTUNO compute a long-term configuration allocation for the whole network. Our results highlight the potential of data analytics for the self-optimization of the future 5G TNs.

In this regard, the paper discusses ongoing work and presents preliminary results using a TSN simulator. The results indicate that several parameters of the high priority traffic such as periods, offsets and preemption modes can have a significant impact on the quality of service (e.g., guaranteed message delivery and message delays) of the BE traffic.

AB  - Fifth generation mobile communication system (5G) integrated with Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) has been deemed as a holistic solution for realizing Industry 4.0, wherein high accuracy of time synchronization is required to enable end-to-end deterministic communication between wireless and wired devices. 3rd Generation Partnership Project(3GPP) TS 23.501 Release 16 has defined the time synchronization mechanism of industrial automation in a 5G-TSN network. This paper briefly reviews the time synchronization scheme of Release 16 and presents the time precision performance considering frequency offset inside 5G System(5GS). It is revealed that frequency offset inside 5GS leads to several microseconds of time error when transmission delay is several tens of milliseconds. As industrial applications require less than 1 microsecond time synchronicity in motion control, the effect of frequency offset inside 5GS needs to be mitigated. In the later part of this paper, a novel method to estimate the frequency offset inside 5GS is presented. The proposed method can be implemented in a simple and effective manner.

AB  - A unified network architecture, allowing for simultaneous transmission of multiple real-time (RT) and non-RT traffic classes, is becoming increasingly important for the realization of industrial IoT. There is yet no clear approach allowing multiple state-of-the-art Industrial Ethernet applications, exhibiting different isochronous hard real-time traffic patterns, to share the same network resources alongside best-effort traffic. This paper presents an approach to integrating heterogeneous Industrial Ethernet applications over Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN). We deploy different real-time schedulers that are embedded in a Software-defined Network (SDN) controller to allow different applications with various traffic patterns and Qualityof-Service (QoS) requirements to share the same network. This integration is accomplished by providing an abstraction that combines the requirements of the Industrial Ethernet application and the TSN network capabilities and constraints.

AB  - The recent trend of moving cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the network is reshaping the way applications and their middleware supports are designed, deployed, and operated. This new model envisions a continuum of virtual resources between the traditional cloud and the network edge, which is potentially more suitable to meet the heterogeneous Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the supported application domains. Yet, mission-critical applications such as those in manufacturing, automation, or automotive, still rely on communication standards like the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) protocol and 5G to ensure a deterministic network behavior: in this context, virtualization might introduce unacceptable network perturbations. In this paper, we demonstrate that latency-sensitive applications can execute in virtual machines without disruptions to their network operations. We propose a novel approach to support the TSN protocol in virtual machines through a precise clock synchronization method and we implement it in integration with state-of-the-art and highly-efficient network virtualization techniques. Our experimental results show that it is possible to achieve deterministic and ultra-low latency end-to-end communication in the cloud continuum, for example providing a guaranteed sub-millisecond latency between remote virtual machines.

AB  - A number of companies and standards development organizations have, since 2000, been producing products and standards for "time-sensitive networks" to support real-time applications that require a) zero packet loss due to buffer congestion, b) extremely low packet loss due to equipment failure, and c) guaranteed upper bounds on end-to-end latency. Often, a robust capability for time synchronization to less than 1 Œºs is also required. These networks consist of specially-featured bridges that are interconnected using standard Ethernet links with standard MAC/PHY layers. Since 2012, this technology has advanced to the use of routers, as well as bridges, and features of interest to time-sensitive networks have been added to both Ethernet and wireless standards.

We further propose a TSN failure recovery routing heuristic used to minimise link congestion, while we also introduce the concept of TSN subgraphs to quickly reschedule the flows traversing the problematic area. We evaluate our approach using SDN-based Source Routing and Linux-based TSN scheduling integrated into Mininet.

AB  - Recent developments in the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) group have put forth a number of mechanisms to improve deterministic latency in layer 2 switches. Their shaping approaches differ with respect to prerequisites, flexibility, maximum latency, and latency variation (jitter). Asynchronous solutions provide flexibility in dynamic scenarios, but Credit-Based Shaping (CBS) and Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) come with a high latency variance, as the minimum latency is not affected by them. Some applications in industrial and automotive use cases require low jitter while trying to avoid a dependency on time synchronization, and even TSN's redundancy mechanism benefits from a lower latency variance. This work is bridging the gap between low-jitter transmission requirements and asynchronous shaping mechanisms. In this paper, the application of a stateless Asynchronous Constant Delay Shaper (ACDS) is discussed. It collects the queuing duration from the previous bridge to delay each frame for the remaining time such that a constant per-hop delay for each frame is achieved. The discussion includes the prerequisites, the mechanism itself, and its technical complexity, as well as a formal analysis of its guaranteed latency by proving its relation to a token-bucket based ATS. Further, two extensions are discussed, and an evaluation shows the applicability of ACDS by comparing its jitter to ATS in a frame-level simulation.

AB  - There are quite tight timing requirements in deterministic low latency network. The IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group has proposed several traffic shapers to satisfy real-time communications requirements. Traditionally, the performance of TSN is analyzed by simulations, whereas these methods cannot cover all corner cases. This paper firstly presented formal models of the TSN‚Äôs time-aware and peristaltic shapers using UPPAAL, tactically solving the problem mentioned above. Afterward, we verified some properties of the shapers models, of which the results could evaluate whether these shapers are able to satisfy strict timing requirements or not. Based on the models, we can discuss about the performance of time-critical traffic combining the preemption mechanism. More-over, we can also analyze resource utilization and transmission latency. Under the time properties analysis and verification of TSN traffic shapers, we can provide engineers with an accessible reference that may assist them in developing the TSN.

AB  - Traditional in-vehicle networks are statically deployed and configured during the car manufacturing process. However, the growing need for supporting new in-car traffic flows, e.g., to add new camera-based Advanced Driver Assistant Systems (ADAS) or infotainment applications, generates an increasing demand for bandwidth and requires the ability for re-configuring the bandwidth allocation among flows during the vehicle lifecycle. For this reason, this work proposes a partitioning system for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) that allows introducing new flows in the in-vehicle network without affecting the already existing ones. Moreover, the letter presents a simulative assessment of the proposed approach in a realistic automotive scenario.

AB  - This paper proposes a method to efficiently map the legacy Ethernet-based traffic into Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) traffic classes considering different traffic characteristics. Traffic mapping is one of the essential steps for industries to gradually move towards TSN, which in turn significantly mitigates the management complexity of industrial communication systems. In this paper, we first identify the legacy Ethernet traffic characteristics and properties. Based on the legacy traffic characteristics we presented a mapping methodology to map them into different TSN traffic classes. We implemented the mapping method as a tool, named Legacy Ethernet-based Traffic Mapping Tool or LETRA, together with a TSN traffic scheduling and performed a set of evaluations on different synthetic networks. The results show that the proposed mapping method obtains up to 90% improvement in the schedulability ratio of the traffic compared to an intuitive mapping method on a multi-switch network architecture.

AB  - In order to achieve the pursuit of deterministic delay and unified network transmission in the industrial automation field, the time-sensitive networking group has developed a stream reservation mechanism to reserve the required bandwidth for time-sensitive traffic. In the distributed network configuration model, how to configure per-hop delay guarantee properly has become a key problem to restrict network performance, the reason is that an excessive loose or tight guarantee will reduce the streams that can be added to the network. Therefore, this paper proposes a stream reservation method based on reinforcement learning which can dynamically adjust the per-hop delay guarantee to improve the acceptance of streams. For this, it firstly defines the optimization problem of network configuration in the reservation process and give the per-hop delay model. Then the operation of the algorithm on bridge's data plane and control plane is simulated. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm with acceptance rate and bandwidth utilization in different scenarios, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - The ongoing transition in industrial automation towards a highly interconnected architecture underscores the importance of time-sensitive networking (TSN). This paper addresses the implementation of a time-predictable software-based TSN-enabled network stack for mixed criticality traffic in TSN end stations. The findings demonstrate the network stack‚Äôs worst-case execution time (WCET) analysability, effective management of mixed critical traffic, and real-time transmission of UDP frames. Additionally, the stack offers modularity, configurability, and TSN support for transferring messages across different priorities using either UDP or TCP. Evaluation on the time-predictable open-source T-CREST platform yields representative WCET estimates comparable to related research. The paper concludes by outlining further research.

AB  - The frame preemption mechanism in Time-Sensitive Networking can effectively improve the transmission latency performance of express frames. However, in different network operating environments, express frame latency presents complex dynamic characteristics. In response to the complexity of express frame latency characteristics under frame preemption conditions, this article first analyzes the operation principle of the frame preemption mechanism and provides a calculation method for the latency of express frames. Then, considering the impact of link utilization and preemptable frame length on the average latency of express frames, we design a simulation analysis algorithm for the latency characteristics of express frames. Finally, using the proposed algorithm, we analyze the average latency, latency randomness, jitter, and latency boundary characteristics of express frames. The research results are valuable for engineering reference for the effective application of the TSN network frame preemption mechanism.

AB  - For many Ethernet-based real-time systems, such as those from automotive, avionics, and industry automation domains, fault tolerance is emerged as an essential requirement for enabling fail-safe or fail-operational behavior. Consequently, the IEEE 802.1CB-2017 standard was published. It is currently the only available time-sensitive networking group standard offering protection against transmission errors. It tackles these faults by preventively replicating the frames and transmitting redundant copies via different paths to the destination. However, in contrast to its obvious advantages, the standard contains some pitfalls: most notably, it lacks protection mechanisms against inadequate configurations, which can not only invalidate the intended increase in reliability but even actively jeopardize the safety of the network. Due to the lack of alternative mechanisms, it is crucial to fully understand the fundamental properties of the standard and its implications on the safety aspects of the network traffic. In this letter, we identify critical aspects and limitations of the standard. We demonstrate the risks of inadequate configurations, discuss their ramifications. Finally, we provide an intuition and initial steps toward deriving the formal worst-case timing analysis of the standard, which is a key requirement for its safe and efficient implementation in the aforementioned real-time domains.

AB  - With the development of hardware virtualization and cloud computing, modern industry has a tendency to upgrade from the traditional industrial networks to virtual machine (VM) based networks. To provide firm latency guarantees for control messages in these networks, the time-sensitive network (TSN) is a promising technology due to its determinacy for real-time applications. However, TSN faces the challenge of providing a rapid response to dynamic transmission requirement changes incurred by VM migrations. In this paper, we proposed an online scheduling approach to deal with dynamic VM migrations in multicast TSN. In this approach, we devise a novel online scheduling framework [minimal distance tree (MDT) construction - heuristic breadth first search] containing an offline scheduling phase and an online rescheduling phase. While the offline phase introduces a MDT to increase reusable scheduling results, the online phase proposes a heuristic scheduling approach to reuse the results of the offline phase as much as possible to accelerate the rescheduling process. Experiments show that our framework can provide a rapid response to dynamic VM migrations compared with the existing approaches where the amount of control data does not exceed 50% of the bandwidth.

IEEE TSN is gaining momentum as a key technology that is able to provide network service guarantees for Ethernet-based communications. Although Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) have been thoroughly investigated in 5G, incorporating TSN technologies in the Transport Network is expected to unleash the potential of end-to-end deterministic communications, especially in industrial environments and time-critical applications like factory automation.We elaborate on the concepts of a TSN-aware Xhaul network, present a novel architecture, and describe a set of amendments required in order to enable network slicing. With the devised approach, a slice-aware TSN-enabled transport network can be controlled and managed in an end-to-end orchestrated way. Implementation experience and evaluation results are reported using TSN-enabled prototype devices, OpenAirInterface (OAI), and JOX slice orchestrator.

AB  - Ethernet has been proposed for the 5G fronthaul to transport the Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) traffic between the radio equipment (RE) and the radio equipment control (REC). The advantages of adopting an Ethernet transport are threefold 1) the low cost of equipment, 2) the use of a shared infrastructure with statistical multiplexing, as well as 3) the ease of operations, administration and maintenance (OAM). In this paper, we introduce distributed timeslot scheduler for CPRI over Ethernet (DTSCoE) as a scheduling algorithm for IEEE 802.1Qbv to support CPRI traffic. DTSCoE is built upon the stream reservation protocol (SRP) IEEE 802.1Qcc to propagate timeslot information across the datapath without any centralized coordination. The simulation results demonstrate that DTSCoE reduces one-way delay to minimum and reduces the jitter to zero which satisfies the CPRI requirements.

AB  - Various modern industrial applications necessitate deterministic communication, assuring that each packet of a data flow arrives at a specific time. Most existing Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) scheduling mechanisms enforce temporary isolation (any two flows cannot simultaneously be in the same queue in a network device) to ensure such deterministic property. This approach has no significant side effects in a wired Ethernet environment. However, recent calls have been made for incorporating TSN and wireless technology, such as 5th generation (5G) network, due to the device‚Äôs mobility and desire for flexibility of many emerging industrial applications. In wireless environments, the fickle nature of wireless communication will cause the existing approach to require more network resources to maintain the deterministic property, resulting in decreased schedulability. Thus, this paper aims to propose a more efficient scheduling mechanism for deterministic communication under integrated 5G and TSN environments. First, we parameterize the residence time of the bridges and analyze the requirements of deterministic communication. Then, based on the analysis, we extend and develop new scheduling rules to improve schedulability while maintaining determinism. Finally, Our evaluation via performing a set of experiments in realistic settings showcases the improved schedulability of our method with the preservation of the deterministic property.

AB  - In-vehicle time-sensitive networking (TSN) delivers highly secure, ultralow latency deterministic communication for intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs). To tackle the traffic scheduling problem of in-vehicle TSN, this study establishes in-vehicle network topologies and flow models, abstracts the traffic scheduling problem as a job-shop scheduling problem (JSSP), and formulates a priority-based optimization function capable of various end-to-end (E2E) delay requirements. A joint routing and scheduling optimization strategy based on improved grey wolf optimization (IGWO) is proposed, which incorporates acrlong LF, historical experience learning, and acrlong TS operators to significantly enhance search capabilities and optimization efficiency. This strategy can rapidly solve large-scale in-vehicle network scheduling and generate scheduling results with outstanding delay performance. Dynamic routing that combines load-balanced and shortest path effectively minimizes interference between flows, further reducing E2E delay. Simulation experiments grounded in realistic ICV scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Furthermore, the simulation results verify the impact of flow period parameters and network topologies on E2E delay, offering guidance for in-vehicle TSN engineering design.

AB  - As substations become increasingly intelligent, a growing disparity arises between the surge in network traffic and the real-time transmission demands of critical communication services. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) offers the capability to shape, schedule, and synchronize data flows, thereby enhancing the transmission quality of time-critical services. We propose a TSN-based intelligent substation traffic scheduling scheme. The transmission delay boundary of substation messages under TSN is calculated based on network calculus theory. The Omnet++ network simulation platform is used for case analysis. Simulation results reveal that, with static configuration of gate control lists, this traffic scheduling approach ensures ultra-low latency and zero jitter for sampled value message transmissions, while concurrently ensuring real-time transmission for all other communication services.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) has emerged as a promising standard for real-time domains. Efficiently determining critical configuration parameters for latency guarantees for time-critical flows remains an open question. Current configuration approaches rely on optimization methods with real-time performance analysis feedback to ensure deadline quality-of-service requirements. However, the ex-post verification-based optimization methods require exhaustive traversal of the entire network search space, leading to significant time consumption. This article proposes a novel, fast, and scalable deadline-aware method for configuring minimum bandwidth allocation for stream reservation (SR) classes in the TSN network, while guaranteeing deadline requirements for all time-critical traffic. We provide formal proof of our approach, which configures critical parameters in a real-time network with prior performance guarantees, thus reducing computational complexity. The analytical method is evaluated on synthetic cases, comparing it with state-of-the-art solutions to demonstrate validity and correctness. Moreover, an adapted real-world case shows the method's scalability, and minimum bandwidth reservations with guaranteed local deadlines for SR classes on all egress ports of the network can be achieved in seconds.

AB  - Ethernet is a key technology to satisfy the communication requirements of future automotive embedded systems. Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) Ethernet is a set of IEEE standards that allows synchronous and time-sensitive communication. It is the favored candidate for backbone and camera applications, but is not expected to replace Controller Area Network (CAN). Instead, both have to coexist in future architectures. No research has been conducted regarding CAN to AVB gateways, and approaches for similar protocols are either not fit or inefficient. In this paper, we present a CAN to AVB Ethernet gateway that allows efficient, real-time capable forwarding. We aggregate and schedule multiple CAN frames into a single AVB Ethernet frame to minimize bandwidth requirements. We evaluate static and dynamic scheduling approaches and determine optimal gateway configurations, showing that the necessary bandwidth reservation is reduced by 72% compared to similar approaches.

The effects of GCL gate opening time, scheduling period, the overlap of transmission Windows, and different priorities of traffic on the delay index were analyzed experimentally, and the end-to-end worst-case transmission delay of time triggered (TT) traffic in the whole process of traffic transmission was calculated. Finally, through comprehensive analysis of GCL and reasonable configuration of parameters, good transmission capacity of the communication network is ensured, which provides a theoretical basis for efficient deployment of the communication network and optimal allocation of network resources.

AB  - Vehicle time-sensitive communication (VTSC) is an emerging paradigm where the Time-Sensitive Networking together with V2X provides connected vehicle with deterministic and low communication latency. Scheduling is a critical step to realize the determinism. Recently, as the scale and variety of VTSCs increase, the requirements of simultaneously achieve multicast supportment, short runtime, dynamic schduling ability and low resource overhead challenge the traditional TSN scheduling algorithms. This article proposes a scheduling scheme with multiple stages to achieve both efficient and rapid scheduling. This article first formulates the joint routing and scheduling problems by proposing a cluster-Integer Linear Programming (CILP). It aims to accelerate the static scheduling and realize real-time response for dynamic incremental scheduling. An improved topology pruning method and a clustering-aggregation ILP procedure are presented. Then, since the dynamic scheduling will gradually reduce the resource utilization, this article proposes an adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) to rapidly perform the resource optimization. The crossover operator, mutation operator, adaptive probability and fitness function are designed, supporting multicast TSN flows. Finally, this article conducts extensive simulations to validate the proposed algorithms. The results show that, comparing with traditional methods, the proposed CILP method can reduce the average runtime by up to 86.7% for static scheduling and realize real-time dynamic scheduling. The proposed AGA method can reduce the resource optimization runtime by up to 70% while improving the schedulability. The overall multi-stage scheduling mechanism could satisfy the VTSC scheduling requirements.

AB  - Deterministic transmission guarantee in time-sensitive networks (TSN) relies on queue models (such as CQF, TAS, ATS) and resource scheduling algorithms. Thanks to its ease of use, the CQF queue model has been widely adopted. However, the existing resource scheduling algorithms of CQF model only focus on periodic time-triggered (TT) flows without consideration of bursting flows. Considering that the bursting flows often carry high-priority data in real systems, in this paper we investigate the mixed-flow (i.e., TT and bursting flows) scheduling problem in CQF-based TSN aiming to maximize the number of schedulable flows and system load balance while satisfying the deterministic demands of delay, jitter, and reliability for both TT and bursting flows. Unfortunately, it is challenging to schedule the mixed flows with the original CQF model because of the huge difference between TT and bursting flows. To resolve this problem, we firstly design an enhanced Multi-CQF model to satisfy the basic demands of bursting flows sent at any time without affecting the deterministic transmission of TT flows. Given the complexity of mixed-flow scheduling and the proposed queue model, it is difficult for traditional algorithms to fully utilize network resources. Thus, we further propose a uline time-correlated uline DRL uline resource uline scheduling (TimeDRS) algorithm to optimize the resource allocation. TimeDRS can be extended to other time-related resource scheduling scenarios, such as TDMA-based scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approaches can greatly reduce frame loss and end-to-end latency for bursting flows, and well balance runtime and schedulability compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks.

AB  - Recently, time-sensitive networking (TSN) has been developed to incorporate real-time capabilities to the standard Ethernet for the incompatible issue in existing industrial communication solutions and is considered a promising solution to satisfy the requirements of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, the routing and scheduling methods are left out of the TSN standard. This study developed a novel joint traffic routing and scheduling algorithm to compute routes for time-critical flows and construct the schedules. The validity of the proposed algorithm was verified using a random synthetic test scenario. The simulation results demonstrated that the real-time requirements of time-critical traffic could be satisfied with the proposed algorithm. Subsequently, we evaluated the scalability of the proposed algorithm from the perspective of the number of flows that can be scheduled and the network size. The results showed that the computational times for 4000 flows in the realistic industrial network topology and random network topologies (with up to 21 switches and 105 end stations) are at the subsecond level, which indicated the perfect scalability of the proposed algorithm. In addition, compared with the well-known integer linear programming (ILP)-based approach, Degree of Conflict (DoC)-aware iterative routing and scheduling (DA/IRS) approach, and hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA)-based approach, the proposed algorithm is faster than the three approaches by at least an order of magnitude.

AB  - With the continued evolution of autonomous driving, the communication demand for in-vehicle networks (IVNs) has dramatically increased, and the traditional IVN solutions have become ineligible for the needs of new in-vehicle applications. Time-sensitive network (TSN) with the characteristics of determinism, low latency, high reliability, large bandwidth, and open industry standards, has been considered as the most promising technology for the next-generation IVNs. This article summarizes the current state and methodologies of in-vehicle TSN research through the following five aspects: 1) Quality of Service (QoS) strategy; 2) reliability; 3) clock synchronization; 4) network planning; and 5) network management. The corresponding research priorities and technical challenges are also addressed, respectively.

AB  - Wireless control applications will play a fundamental role in future factory environments to enable novel mobility use cases and achieve the desired flexibility in production. The standardized integration of 5G into a time-sensitive networking (TSN) environment defines the joint architecture and communication interfaces between the different networks to support time-critical applications. Managing and scheduling such a network in an end-to-end fashion to guarantee the stringent QoS requirements is however a complex task. In this work, we present an efficient window-based resource allocation method for the end-to-end network. A big challenge in scheduling periodic and time-critical control applications over a wireless system is the uncertainty of the channel. We hence introduce a fading correlation-aware optimization to find robust schedules. Our simulation study shows that this approach is able to reduce peak resource demands and hence improve the schedulability compared to standard channel-unaware TSN scheduling.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) technology is key to the development of current networks due to its capacity to provide a deterministic Quality of Service (QoS) mainly in terms of delay for different industrial traffic. It also simplifies management and improves the scalability of industrial networks. This articles focuses on Asynchronous Traffic Shape (ATS) for TSN. The key aspect of ATS is that by prioritizing flows delay requirement can be satisfied for each priority level. To that end, we formally formulate the problem of flow priority assignment in an network and we demonstrate the optimality of our proposed algorithm. We have compared our algorithm with the brute force search obtaining that the execution time of brute force is much higher than ours with exactly the same prioritization results.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is considered to be an important means to achieve deterministic low-latency transmission, and traffic scheduling and routing are the keys to deterministic transmission. In this paper we first formulate the routing and scheduling joint optimization problem in TSN networks, where the schedulability of all data flows in the network is minimized by optimizing the transmission time slots of each data flow while considering routing. The optimal routing scheme is first determined using a heuristic algorithm, and then the scheduling scheme for each data stream is determined based on the constraints. To further optimize the schedulability ratio, the scheduling order among data flows is optimized using the Genetic Algorithm (GA). Simulation results show that compared with the traditional algorithms, the proposed algorithm has a higher schedulability and shorter running time even when the network size increases gradually.

AB  - Cyber-physical power system (CPPS) stability is severely affected by the communication network performance due to cyber-physical interdependence. Thus, uncertain cyber-physical coordinated attacks (CPCA) pose more significant threats to CPPS than physical attacks. However, the defense strategies in recent works assume real-time and reliable transmission under an ideal cyber-attack, leading to inaccurate cyber-physical interdependence modeling. Therefore, the strategies are ineffective against uncertain CPCA. This paper proposes a hierarchical CPPS network architecture that integrates time-sensitive networking (TSN) to improve resilience against uncertain CPCA. To model the uncertain CPCA, a coordinated N-K ambiguity set is proposed considering all possible link failures on both cyber and physical layers. For the cyber layer, we propose a joint routing-scheduling model of TSN-based network to support deterministic and reliable data transmission, which improves the accuracy of cyber-physical interdependence. A distributionally robust coordinated defense (DRCD) strategy integrated with cyber-physical interdependence is then proposed to mitigate the priority-based load shedding considering the uncertainties of CPCA. The formulated DRCD strategy is linearized and transformed into a tri-level optimization problem which is efficiently solved by C-CG algorithm. Case studies indicate that the DRCD strategy has superiorities in improving the resilience of CPPS compared with other conventional models.

AB  - Highly reliable, scalable and deployable net-works with strict temporal constraints are inevitable for future cyber physical systems. Due to widespread usage and success of Ethernet technologies, the Time Sensitive Networking task group introduces a series of protocol extensions to the IEEE 802.1 Ethernet standard. These standards provide real time capabilities and performance improvements. Simulation environments are intensively used to investigate correctness and applicability of new protocol suites. This paper presents an OPNET simulation framework for simulating TSN time-based features. Our framework implements ingress time-based policing and enhancements for scheduled traffic as an extensions of the Ethernet standard. We describe the implementation details of our simulation models which provide temporal properties. We also evaluate and compare our results with the expected behaviors of the aforementioned protocols.

AB  - The upcoming IEEE Time Sensitive Networking standard will offer a set of new functionality for Ethernet like frame preemption and frame replication that need careful evaluation. The IETF DetNet working group also works on deterministic layer 3 segments and leverages therefore works from the IEEE group. We present here a simulation framework based on OMNeT++ that implements all non time-based features present in TSN in a modular and easily extendable way. The framework gives other researches a stable base to start evaluating existing and future scenarios. An evaluation of frame preemption as well as per-stream policing based on the framework is presented. It was shown, that frame preemption does not always bring latency advantages and highly depends on configuration of the system. The paper concludes with an overview of the computational cost for the use of this framework.

AB  - Ethernet is an emerging technology in the automotive domain and is capable to overcome the bandwidth and scalability limits of traditional buses like CAN or FlexRay. Formal performance analysis methods are required to verify the timing, e.g. by providing upper bounds on end-to-end latencies, in safety-critical real-time systems, such as automotive control and advanced driver assistance systems. In many real-time capable Ethernet implementations such as IEEE 802.1Q or AVB, frames can be prioritized and frames of equal priority are scheduled in FIFO order at the switch ouput ports. In this paper, we show how to exploit Ethernet's FIFO scheduling in a compositional formal performance analysis to derive tighter timing guarantees. In an automotive Ethernet setup, our proposed analysis leads to a significant reduction in end-to-end latency guarantees.

AB  - Real-time communication of distributed automation systems come with many challenges as there is no common time basis. Often a periodic execution of applications is considered which leads to time phenomena like drifts or jitter. Thus, this type of communication requires observance and enforcement of real-time properties to guarantee reliability of distributed systems. New industrial technologies like Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and the IEC 61499 standard provide support to conquer upcoming challenges. Therefore, we are using these jointly with contract-based design to propose a design methodology for verification of real-time communication in IEC 61499 systems. We implemented a simulation-based verification environment and performed postmortem trace-based verification against timing specifications. The evaluation confirms the possibility of integrating our proposed representation for non-local communication into IEC 61499 for analyzing time behavior of applications.

AB  - Industrial communication systems represent one of the most important innovations of the last decades in the context of factory and process automation systems. They are networks specifically designed to cope with the tight requirements of these challenging application fields such as real time, determinism, and reliability. Moreover, industrial networks are often deployed in environments characterized by strong electromagnetic interference, mechanical stress, critical temperature, and humidity. Over the last three decades, different classes of industrial networks have been developed according to changing requirements and available communication and information technologies. In this paper, we first provide an account of the state of the art, reviewing classical fieldbuses, real-time Ethernet networks, and industrial wireless networks, along with their most relevant features, applications, and performance figures. We introduce the complex standardization framework and analyze the market status and assumptions for future development. In the second part, we address the future perspectives focusing on new technologies, standards, and fields of application. In particular, we consider the time-sensitive networking (TSN) family of standards, Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) systems, high-performance wireless LANs, industrial applications of cellular networks, and Ethernet networks for automotive communication.

AB  - Modern in-vehicle networks are comprised of heterogeneous systems that use various communication protocols with different source clocks. Moreover, gateway systems are designed with additional features that ensure converted/forwarded data meet real-time constraints. In this paper, we propose a synchronization mechanism for FlexRay and Ethernet audio video bridging (AVB) network that guarantees a high quality-of-service. We also designed the corresponding embedded system based-gateway system. Moreover, we built an in-vehicle network environment that consists of FlexRay and Ethernet AVB networks using an embedded system, which is integrated and synchronized by the gateway. We evaluate the synchronization performance of the proposed method using the developed gateway by conducting experiments as well as a theoretical analysis. The results of the experiment show that the synchronization mechanism provides timing guarantees for the FlexRay network that are similar to those of the Ethernet AVB network.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Deterministic Networking (DetNet) standards come to satisfy the needs of many industries for deterministic network services. That is the ability to establish a multi-hop path over an IP network for a given flow with deterministic Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees in terms of latency, jitter, packet loss, and reliability. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning-based solution, which is dubbed LEARNET, for the flow scheduling in deterministic asynchronous networks. The solution leverages predictive data analytics and reinforcement learning to maximize the network operator's revenue. We evaluate the performance of LEARNET through simulation in a fifth-generation (5G) asynchronous deterministic backhaul network where incoming flows have characteristics similar to the four critical 5GQoS Identifiers (5QIs) defined in Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) TS 23.501 V16.1.0. Also, we compared the performance of LEARNET with a baseline solution that respects the 5QIs priorities for allocating the incoming flows. The obtained results show that, for the scenario considered, LEARNET achieves a gain in the revenue of up to 45% compared to the baseline solution.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) evolves from Ethernet AVB in which the Credit-Based Shaping (CBS) is employed to guarantee the deterministic transmission of traffic. In CBS, the real-time performance of traffic associated with the credits can practicably settle the uncertainty of queueing and forwarding for stream-reservation traffic. Hence, the optimization of bandwidth allocation under the CBS becomes a key point to ensure guaranteed performance in the network. In this paper, a bandwidth allocation method is proposed for stream-reservation traffic while the real-time requirements are satisfied. We first illustrate the significance of appropriate bandwidth allocation for traffic under the CBS and construct a general schema for its bandwidth allocation. Also, the influences of the protected window for Control Data Traffic (CDT) on stream-reservation traffic are considered in our method. Further, mathematical models are constructed to analyze the delay bounds and backlogs of traffic to form the feedback for the optimal bandwidth allocation process. Finally, two node-level cases with different bandwidth utilization and a synthetic industrial networking scenario are carried out to demonstrate our method. The results confirm that the excessive reserved bandwidth does not necessarily decrease the delay bound, especially under the high traffic loads scenario. A more desirable bandwidth allocation strategy under the CBS mechanism is that the reserved bandwidth should be just enough according to the traffic loads to ensure the deterministic transmission of traffic.

AB  - For time-sensitive networks, as in the context of IEEE TSN and IETF Detnet, cyclic dependencies are associated with certain fundamental properties such as improving availability and decreasing reconfiguration effort. Nevertheless, the existence of cyclic dependencies can cause very large latency bounds or even global instability, thus making the proof of the timing predictability of such networks a much more challenging issue. Cyclic dependencies can be removed by reshaping flows inside the network, by means of regulators. We consider FIFO-per-class networks with two types of regulators: perflow regulators and interleaved regulators (the latter reshape entire flow aggregates). Such regulators come with a hardware cost that is less for an interleaved regulator than for a perflow regulator; both can affect the latency bounds in different ways. We analyze the benefits of both types of regulators in partial and full deployments in terms of latency. First, we propose Low-Cost Acyclic Network (LCAN), a new algorithm for finding the optimum number of regulators for breaking all cyclic dependencies. Then, we provide another algorithm, Fixed- Point Total Flow Analysis (FP-TFA), for computing end-to-end delay bounds for general topologies, i.e., with and without cyclic dependencies. An extensive analysis of these proposed algorithms was conducted on generic grid topologies. For these test networks, we find that FP-TFA computes small latency bounds; but, at a medium to high utilization, the benefit of regulators becomes apparent. At high utilization or for high line transmission-rates, a small number of per-flow regulators has an effect on the latency bound larger than a small number of interleaved regulators. Moreover, interleaved regulators need to be placed everywhere in the network to provide noticeable improvements. We validate the applicability of our approaches on a realistic industrial timesensitive network.

AB  - Communication requirements in automotive electronics are steadily increasing. To satisfy this demand and enable future automotive embedded architectures, new interconnect technologies are needed. Audio Video Bridging (AVB) Ethernet is a promising candidate to accomplish this as it features timesensitive and synchronous communication in combination with high bit rates. However, there is a lack of commercial products as well as research regarding AVB-capable system-on-chips (SoCs). In this paper, we investigate how and at what cost a legacy Ethernet MAC can be enhanced into an AVB Ethernet controller. Using FPGA prototyping and a real system based on an ARM Cortex-A9 SoC running Linux, we conducted a series of experiments to evaluate important performance metrics and to validate our design decisions. We achieved frame release latencies of less than 6 Œºs and time-synchronization with an endpoint-induced inaccuracy of up to 8 Œºs.

AB  - In this paper we are interested in real-time control applications that are implemented using Fog Computing Platforms consisting of interconnected heterogeneous Fog Nodes (FNs). Similar to previous research and ongoing standardization efforts, we assume that the communication between FNs is achieved via the IEEE 802.1 Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) standard. We model the control applications as a set of real-time flows, and we assume that the messages are transmitted using scheduled traffic that is using the Gate Control Lists (GCLs) in TSN. Given a network topology and a set of control applications, we are interested to synthesize the GCLs for messages such that the Quality-of-Control (QoC) of control applications is maximized and the deadlines of real-time messages are satisfied. We have proposed a Constraint Programming (CP)-based solution to this problem, and developed an accurate analytical model for QoC, which, together with a metaheuristic search employed in the CP solver can drive the search quickly towards good quality solutions. We have evaluated the proposed strategy on several test cases including realistic test cases and also validate the resulted GCLs on a TSN hardware platform and via simulations in OMNET++.

AB  - The introduction of IEEE Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) enables the design of real-time and mission-critical networks based on Ethernet technologies. Apart from providing necessary tools for near-deterministic scheduling, TSN comes with further functionalities for configurability, security, and reliability. IEEE 802.1CB Frame Replication and Elimination (FRER) is the only protocol in the TSN toolbox for adding fault-tolerance via sending the same packets via redundant paths. Although its core functions are defined by the standard, its effective use mainly depends on the actual deployment scenario and the path selection strategy. In this paper, we show that FRER can induce unintentional elimination of packets packets when the paths chosen for a particular packet flow are non-disjoint. We propose the new metric reassurance that can be used in FRER path selection. Besides, we propose an additional enhancement to FRER that can prevent unintended packet eliminations independent from the deployment scenario. Our simulation results indicate that the reassurance-based path selection performs better than random or maximum-disjoint path selection in random failure scenarios.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an exponential growth of IoT (Internet of Things) devices in the market and increasingly, they are being part of critical mission functionalities for many industries. For this reason, processes associated with these devices are generating new requirements at the level of interconnectivity, security, and scalability. Due to the large volume of devices, this growth process has tested the existing communications infrastructure, deployment architecture, different support services, technical requirements and the intrinsic characteristics of the services offered. In this sense, the use of Edge Computing schemes and TSN (Time-Sensitive Networking), is proposed as a tool for supporting IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) services to achieve optimization and assurance processes of latency, scalability and interoperability parameters required by critical mission services such as health, transportation and production. In this sense, we propose several strategies for assuring low latency, scalability and interoperability in Edge Computing and TSN networks for critical IIoT services. These strategies are evaluated considering different levels of congestion and considering different schemes such as best effort, TSN and Edge Computing.

AB  - With the rapid development of industrial automation, higher requirements are put forward for reliable and deterministic communication in industrial networks. And time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a promising technology that can satisfy such deterministic transmission requirements. Currently, TSN typically uses the shortest path routing (SPR) algorithm to determine the transmission path of traffic. However, the SPR algorithm may cause a high load on a single path, which makes it difficult to improve the schedulability and determinism of time-triggered (TT) traffic. In this paper, a TSN traffic scheduling method based on Q-learning routing optimization for TT traffic is proposed, and the transmission performance of the proposed method is tested. The results show that the delay and jitter of TT traffic are reduced after using this method.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), as a set of the protocols of data link layer, is proposed by the IEEE 802.1 task group to ensure the real-time and deterministic network communication. However, the computation and configuration of the synchronous TSN scheduling problem is a non-deterministic polynomial hard (NP-hard) problem. To deal with such a problem, a fast solution algorithm is proposed in this paper based on the flow-by-flow method and dynamic programming method. Firstly, the difficulty aroused from the synchronization error is analyzed and the corresponding queue and gating resources for frames are reserved to guarantee the feasibility of the solution. Secondly, the upper and lower bounds of each frame are defined such that dynamic time margin is calculated. In addition, with the above bounds, two necessary feasibility conditions for the synchronous TSN scheduling problem are given, which can judge whether the problem is feasible before the scheduling. Finally, the queue arrangement problem with complex coupling constraints is solved by dynamic programming method with the aim of minimizing end-to-end delay. The proposed algorithm is verified, and the results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in obtaining the feasible and satisfactory scheduling scheme within a short time.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) has great potential as an airborne network to interconnect modules in integrated modular avionics (IMA) system. For TSN-based IMA system, the hybrid scheduling of processing in modules and communication in TSN can guarantee its real-time performance. However, traditional task-message scheduling methods still lack applicability and scalability due to their incompatibility with the partition-task hierarchical architecture in modules and high complexity brought by the tight coupling of tasks and messages. Partition-message scheduling methods can ensure this applicability and scalability, but cannot coordinate tasks with messages well, thus sacrificing real-time guarantee capabilities. Namely, existing methods cannot comprehensively ensure the scheduling performance, including applicability, real-time, and scalability. Therefore, we propose a novel loosely coupled partition-(task)-message scheduling framework. It takes partitions and messages as scheduling objects and uses tasks as their coordination medium, to overcome the dependencies of existing methods on time-triggered tasks and guarantee applicability. Besides, it can also enhance real-time performance by analyzing task execution boundaries and application-layer end-to-end delays, and improve scalability through parallel optimizing and the incremental solving with block identification and adaptive adjustment. Experiments validate that it can schedule complex systems with up to 150 partitions, 1000 tasks, and 600 messages. Compared with the existing methods, it can accelerate the solving speed by 41% and reduce end-to-end delays by 27%.

These concepts are intimately associated with highly distributed and cooperative architectures that rely, naturally, on the network infrastructure. However, traditional industrial communication technologies hardly provide the required level of integration, flexibility and performance. Seeking a solution to this mismatch, we assess two technologies that appeared recently in the industrial realm, namely IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). TSN and SDN are fundamentally different, thus having distinct strengths and weaknesses. This paper reviews their fundamental operation principles, evaluating them qualitatively against the specific requirements posed by Industry 4.0.

AB  - ARINC 664, which is a heavily used protocol for modern avionics networks, is preferred due to its simplicity although its mixed-criticality support is limited. Time Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet), and IEEE Time Sensitive Networking (TSN), which utilize time synchronized schedule, are more suitable for supporting mixed-criticality applications; however, both require a fault tolerant time synchronization that makes the certification process more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic priority assignment (DPA) concept together with the burst limiting shaper (BLS) from the IEEE TSN standard to enhance the schedulability and the mixed-criticality support of ARINC 664. The decision of flow re-assignment to a new priority class is done by calculating the high priority (HP) and low priority (LP) class worst-case delays using the network calculus framework. The numerical results show that the class utilization rates can be significantly increased by using the DPA concept with and without the BLS while the deadline constraints for all classes are satisfied. Thus, the DPA can improve the schedulability and mixed-criticality of ARINC 664 without using any time synchronization mechanism.

AB  - With the continuous evolution of industrial network technology, industrial production has higher and higher requirements for reliability and real-time performance. At present Time Sensitive Networks (TSN) has become one of the evolution directions of the next generation network bearing technology. In TSN, redundancy is usually adopted to meet the reliability requirements of Time-Triggered (TT) flow. However, a large amount of bandwidth consumption caused by redundancy is also inevitable, which will directly affect the schedulability of TT flows. Therefore, this paper proposes a Genetically based Reliable Routing algorithm (GRR) based on Frame Replication and Elimination for Reliability (FRER) standard, which provides reliable and non-overlapping routes for different copies of each TT flow. It not only guarantees the reliability of the TT flow, but also increases its schedulability, so as to meet the needs of industrial applications. Through simulation experiments, compared with the existing methods, the reliability of the proposed reliable routing algorithm is improved by 2.08% on average and the schedulability is improved by 6.3% on average.

AB  - This work presents a novel use case with Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN) for implementing a deterministic system allowing the joint transmission of all substation communications over the same Ethernet-based infrastructure. This approach streamlines the transition to Smart Grid by simplifying the typically complex architecture of electrical substations, characterized by multiple field buses and bridging devices. Thus, Smart Grid represents a disruptive innovation advancing substations to an ‚Äúall-digital‚Äù environment with a uniform interface to access, manage, and update their communications and variables. TSN can serve as its underlying foundation as it is based on open, interoperable standards and enhancements for Ethernet that can establish deterministic communications with bounded end-to-end latency. This is shown with a TSN Proof of Concept (PoC) in a real-life substation that can integrate its most usual signals: digitized analog triggers for critical events or interlocks, GOOSE signaling (IEC 61850), and Best-Effort ‚ÄúInternet-like‚Äù traffic. This TSN PoC is shown to be versatile enough to propagate digitized critical events around 160 Œºs earlier than legacy substation equipment while preserving the integrity of background traffic. Furthermore, its flexibility was characterized in-depth in controlled laboratory tests, thereby confirming TSN as a viable alternative for supporting Smart Grid so long as the appropriate configuration is supplied.

AB  - Large complex industrial Distributed Control Systems (DCS), e.g., power distribution systems, are expected to function for long time, up to 40 years. Therefore, besides having a long system verification phase for all subsystems, the design phase should consider various aspects when it comes to selection of which technologies to utilize when implementing such systems. In this paper, we study and investigate key challenges of using the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) technology when it comes to design, maintenance and evolution of long life-span complex DCS. We also identify issues and challenges, and propose mitigation strategies for using the TSN technology in long-life system design. Our investigation and analysis shows that many of the TSN standards are in their evolution phase and may as a consequence be subject to different interpretations and implementations. Therefore, achieving a full capacity of using the TSN technology may not be possible, in particular when it comes to design of systems having an expected long life.

AB  - A recent trend in embedded industry is to mix Integrated Modular Architectures (IMA) with Time Sensitive Networking (TSN). IMA principles allow resource sharing between numerous software functions in a deterministic way. On the other side TSN is considered a promising communication solution for distributed architectures. However, TSN has not been fully exploited with IMA, while it would meet the increasing communication needs due to the explosion of the number of on-board software functions. In order to better understand the challenges of designing IMA-TSN systems, this paper proposes a joint model which unifies task and message management and allows evaluation of end-to-end latency properties. The model is illustrated by simulation on an avionic case study.

AB  - IEEE802.1Qbv (Time-aware Shaper: TAS) has recently been applied within user networks (NWs) for realizing factory automation and remote control. As mass customization matures, TAS is expected to extend its application coverage to not only user NWs but also wide-area NWs to enable real-time communication for remote control and cloud-based application use. However, designing a TAS schedule is an NP-hard problem, which becomes more difficult as the gate control list (GCL) hypercycle increases. In this paper, we propose a method to convert the transmission cycle of Talker to a different cycle time for TAS scheduling in a carrier NW. This results in a smaller GCL hypercycle in the carrier NW. Our evaluation experiments show that the GCL computation time of the proposed method is shorter. This paper contributes to the realization of TAS in the wide-area NW, which has not been discussed so far.

AB  - Edge enabled Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform is of great significance to accelerate the development of smart industry. However, with the dramatic increase in real-time IIoT applications, it is a great challenge to support fast response time, low latency, and efficient bandwidth utilization. To address this issue, time sensitive network (TSN) is recently researched to realize low latency communication via deterministic scheduling. To the best of our knowledge, the combinability of multiple flows, which can significantly affect the scheduling performance, has never been systematically analyzed before. In this article, we first analyze the combinability problem. Then, a noncollision theory based deterministic scheduling (NDS) method is proposed to achieve ultralow latency communication for the time-sensitive flows. Moreover, to improve bandwidth utilization, a dynamic queue scheduling (DQS) method is presented for the best-effort flows. Experiment results demonstrate that NDS/DQS can well support deterministic ultralow latency services and guarantee efficient bandwidth utilization.

AB  - Delay and jitter sensitive industrial control and remote driving application-driven network by best-effort to deterministic service. To meet the deterministic application of delay and jitter demands, industry and academia have conducted detailed research on stream filtering shaping and queue forwarding control. However, the study seldom considers the effects of long-distance topology change, transmission delay fluctuations and short-time traffic overloads, challenging to meet deterministic requirements under large-scale backbone networks. For this challenge, this paper based on Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding, considers source-destination path properties and deterministic traffic intensity. We propose Global Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding 3-Queue. In the deterministic network simulation system based on OMNeT, we constructed the actual network topology NSFNET, which has 14 nodes and 21 links. Experiments compare queue forwarding control mechanisms such as CQF and GCQF-3. The experimental results show that under the traffic matrix with 120% strength, the delay is reduced by 23.6%, the jitter is reduced by 53.6%, and the packet loss rate is reduced by 61%. It shows that GCQF-3 can timely adjust the gate-control and queueing priority according to the deterministic traffic state, achieves the best in delay, jitter and network utilization.

AB  - Thanks to the standards being developed by IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group, the classical IEEE 802.1 Ethernet architecture is now enhanced to accommodate real-time and safety-critical requirements emerging in various cyber-physical systems. The deterministic nature of the communication is achieved through the time-triggered traffic, which requires introducing strict scheduling constraints that may be an obstacle in finding a feasible schedule. In this article, we propose a simple hardware enhancement of a switch along with a relaxed scheduling constraint that increases schedulability and throughput of the time-triggered traffic but maintains the deterministic nature and timeliness guarantees in a TSN network. We give a formal proof to justify the claims and an algorithm benchmarking and experimental validation to demonstrate the gains. The results show that the number of flows that can be scheduled in the model with the relaxed constraint is on average by 75.1 % larger than in the traditional model.

AB  - Industrial real-time applications demand their communication networks be robust and deterministic so that packets are delivered with bounded delay and jitter. The IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group has amended the standards of IEEE 802.3 Ethernet to support time-triggered flows of real-time applications. However, the issues of routing and scheduling are left as open problems. Specifically, majority of the state-of-the-art scheduling efforts make certain assumptions, such as assuming that the routing information is known \textit{a priori} to focus on the scheduling problem or assuming that the information of flows is known in advance. Other studies that avoided these assumptions ignore certain valuable information that could be taken advantage of to make better routing decisions, such as the residual bandwidth. In this paper, we first propose an incremental QoS-aware path selection algorithm that uses QoS measurement to route TSN flows. Then, we introduce multiple incremental scheduling algorithms that address above mentioned issues, and demonstrate their performance.

Such network should support existing time-constrained avionics flows, as well as new best effort traffic, requiring scheduling algorithms to meet guarantees on avionics flows. Following the current trend of the automotive industry to move toward Audio/Video Bridging (AVB), this paper evaluates an application of the scheduling scheme described in the emerging IEEE 802.1 AVB standard in an avionics switched Ethernet scenario. Results are compared to other common scheduling strategies such as strict priority queuing, and different fair scheduling variants.

AB  - Ethernet has been a backbone of data centers since inception of cloud computing. The reason is its simplicity, cost effectiveness, wide existing base, and maturity. However, Ethernet is unreliable when it comes to providing guaranteed transmission. Consequently, IEEE 802.1Qbb standard has been introduced to provide reliability based on congestion notification (CN) mechanism of IEEE 802.3x. However, IEEE 802.1Qbb has some issues and limitations, such as higher buffer space reservation, lack of support for heterogeneous switching devices, and low throughput and efficiency of the network. This letter proposes a novel approach for modified CN mechanism that provides 44 percent less space reservation for CN mechanism, support for heterogeneity, higher throughput, and efficiency.

AB  - Software defined networking (SDN) aims to standardize the control and configuration of network infrastructure. It consolidates network control by moving the network's control plane to a (logically) centralized controller and downgrading switches to simple forwarding devices. This offers huge advantages for future automotive Ethernet networks, including admission control (e.g. to prevent/limit congestion) or network reconfiguration (e.g. in case of faults), both based on a centralized view of the current network state. SDN's centralized architecture, however, requires additional communication, which entails a certain overhead. If SDN is used in safety-critical real-time networks, this communication is subject to strict timing requirements. In this paper, we present a formal analysis based evaluation of the general suitability of SDN for time-sensitive networks including overhead, scalability, and timing guarantees by using a realistic automotive setup.

AB  - The in-vehicle network (IVN) architecture significantly impacts the performance of high-level autonomous vehicles. This paper proposed an innovative optimization design framework for in-vehicle time-sensitive networking (TSN) architecture. This pioneering framework is specifically designed to optimize switch port assignment, load distribution, and end-to-end delay. To balance port allocation and load distribution, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated. An adaptive non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), which in-corporates adaptive crossover and mutation probabilities, is employed to identify candidate topologies. The end-to-end delay is evaluated by an improved gray wolf optimizer (IGWO) based TSN scheduling algorithm. By integrating genetic and tabu search operators, the efficiency and scheduling effectiveness of the IGWO are significantly enhanced. The simulation verifies the superiority of the adaptive NSGA-II and IGWO on search capability. A design instance for a high-level autonomous vehicle is completed based on the proposed framework. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the design framework, and some design ideas are summarized.

AB  - In IEEE 802.1Q with Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) extension, the timing constraint is enforced by providing deterministic transmission policies when both Real-Time (RT) and Non-Real-Time (NRT) streams are transmitted. The transmission of non-preemptive NRT streams may, however, unexpectedly intrude into the next time slice of RT streams, thus jeopardizing RT streams' timing constraints. Guard bands are therefore introduced to prevent such negative influence by inserting a duration in front of every time slice that contains RT streams, but one major disadvantage is wasting bandwidth in resource-limited networks. Several methods have been proposed to reduce guard bands by aggregating time slices to tackle the above problem. However, there is still room for improvement in reduction. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimized TSN scheduling synthesis for RT streams in IEEE Standard 802.1Qbv with a global perspective to efficiently reduce guard bands. We add a constraint to avoid creating extra guard bands during scheduling generation and an objective function to minimize the maximum number of guard bands. Due to the general constraints and objective function, our proposed method can also apply to streams with multiple periods. In the performance evaluation, we show that the proposed approach effectively reduces guard bands while achieving an average improvement of up to 38.6% against the state-of-the-art.

AB  - Recent studies leverage time-aware shaper (TAS) and frame replication and elimination for reliability (FRER) techniques to achieve deterministic latency and high reliability for time-triggered (TT) flows. FRER requires transmitting TT flows on $k$ disjoint paths to tolerate transient and permanent failures. However, directly allocating timeslot resources for all $k$ TT flows will dramatically increase the computational complexity of gate control lists (GCLs), seriously impair scheduling capabilities, and result in a wastage of bandwidth. In this paper, we propose an ultra-reliable time-aware shaper (uTAS). uTAS only allocates timeslots for one TT flow to ensure deterministic transmission. The $k - 1$ replica TT (RT) flows are delivered using a best-effort strategy. On this basis, we propose an adaptive window scheduling (AWS) algorithm based on network calculus, which aims to guarantee that RT flows reach their destinations within the deadline. Evaluation results show that uTAS can meet the flow reliability and deadline requirements. Compared to directly combining TAS and FRER (DCTF), uTAS reduces the total number of GCLs by approximately 72.9%.
