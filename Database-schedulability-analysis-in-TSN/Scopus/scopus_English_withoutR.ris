AB  - Avionics Full-DupleX (AFDX) is a switched Ethernet-based network used in modern commercial airplanes for the transmission of command and control avionics flows. These critical flows require deterministic guarantees leading to a lightly loaded network. Aircraft manufacturers envision to carry additional non avionics flows (i.e. video, audio, service) to take advantage of the spare bandwidth. However, it is then compulsory to preserve the real-time guarantees of avionics flows in terms of bounded jitter at the transmitter output and of bounded end-to-end latency. Depending on the type of additional traffic, Quality of Service (QoS) end-to-end guarantees may be offered to the additional flows of lower criticality in terms of reduced delay or bounded jitter for instance. These guarantees can be ensured by scheduling policies at transmitter and switch level. However, an important safety-related constraint is the asynchronous design of avionics distributed systems that prohibits the use of a network-wide synchronization of end systems and switches. Thus, time-triggered networking such as emerging Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet) or Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) cannot be leveraged. This paper underlines the benefits of only scheduling flows at the transmitter, which is compatible with the asynchronous safety constraint of avionics systems. We show that it is possible to build a table schedule that carries both critical avionics flows and additional video flows that meet their timing and bandwidth allocation constraints. Therefore, we design scheduling strategies for efficient distribution of flows in the table scheduling whose performance is compared to the optimal schedule minimizing the emission lag of additional flows. Proposed heuristics are constructed such as to favor the network responsiveness for avionics flows thanks to slot over-provisioning. Extensive results on an A350 AFDX industrial configuration show that for a transmitter load of up to 70% of the available bandwidth, the uniform allocation heuristic provides a performance close to optimal in terms of minimum emission lag for additional flows, so offering a practical configuration heuristic to industry. © 2024

AB  - Offline scheduling of Scheduled Traffic (ST) in Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN) without taking into account the quality of service of non-ST traffic, e.g., time-sensitive traffic such as Audio-Video Bridging (AVB) traffic, can potentially cause deadline misses for non-ST traffic. In this paper, we report our ongoing work to propose a solution that, regardless of the ST scheduling algorithm being used, can ensure meeting timing requirements for non-ST traffic. To do this, we define a frame called Guard Frame (GF) that will be scheduled together with all ST frames. We show that a proper design for the GFs will leave necessary porosity in the ST schedules to ensure that all non-ST traffic will meet their timing requirements. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In order to more accurately analyze the problem of time delay simulation and calculation in the time-sensitive network (TSN) of vehicular Ethernet, a TSN reservation class data delay analysis model improved based on the State–Action–Reward–State–Action (SARSA) reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the TSN data queue forwarding delay model and reservation class data delay analysis intelligent body model are established, then the TSN traffic scheduling mechanism is improved by the SARSA reinforcement learning algorithm, and the improved TSN network reservation class data analysis model is established for the uncertainty of traffic scheduling in the network; finally, the fitting performance of the proposed method is verified by simulation and experimental validation. The results show that the deviation between the two is less than 5% under different BE loads, i.e., the established reservation class data delay analysis model is able to correctly fit the scheduling mechanism of the vehicle-mounted TSN network, which proves the reasonableness of the model simulation. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Recent studies leverage time-aware shaper (TAS) and frame replication and elimination for reliability (FRER) techniques to achieve deterministic latency and high reliability for time-triggered (TT) flows. FRER requires transmitting TT flows on k disjoint paths to tolerate transient and permanent failures. However, directly allocating timeslot resources for all k TT flows will dramatically increase the computational complexity of gate control lists (GCLs), seriously impair scheduling capabilities, and result in a wastage of bandwidth. In this paper, we propose an ultra-reliable time-aware shaper (uTAS). uTAS only allocates timeslots for one TT flow to ensure deterministic transmission. The k - 1 replica TT (RT) flows are delivered using a best-effort strategy. On this basis, we propose an adaptive window scheduling (AWS) algorithm based on network calculus, which aims to guarantee that RT flows reach their destinations within the deadline. Evaluation results show that uTAS can meet the flow reliability and deadline requirements. Compared to directly combining TAS and FRER (DCTF), uTAS reduces the total number of GCLs by approximately 72.9%. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - To support reliable and low-latency communication, Time-Sensitive Networking introduced protocols and interfaces for resource allocation in Ethernet. However, the implementation of these allocation algorithms has not yet been covered by the standards. Our work focuses on deadline-guaranteeing resource allocation for networks with static and dynamic traffic. To achieve this, we combine offline network optimization heuristics with online admission control and, thus, allow for new flow registrations while the network is running. We demonstrate our solution on Credit-Based Shaper networks by using the delay analysis framework Network Calculus. We compare our approach with an intuitive and a brute-force algorithm, where we can achieve significant improvements, both, in terms of quality and runtime. Thereby, our results show that we can guarantee maximum end-to-end delays and also increase the flexibility of the network while requiring only minimal user input. © 2024, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and edge computing are promising networking technologies for the future of the Industrial Internet. TSN provides a reliable and deterministic low-latency communication service for edge computing. The Frame Replication and Elimination for Reliability (FRER) mechanism is important for improving the network reliability of TSN. It achieves high reliability by transmitting identical frames in parallel on two disjoint paths, while eliminating duplicated frames at the destination node. However, there are two problems with the FRER mechanism. One problem is that it does not consider the path reliability, and the other one is that it is difficult to find two completely disjoint path pairs in some cases. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a method to find edge-disjoint path pairs considering path reliability for FRER in TSN. The method includes two parts: one is building a reliability model for paths, and the other one is computing a working path and a redundant path with the Edge-Disjoint Path Pairs Selection (EDPPS) algorithm. Theoretical and simulation results show that the proposed method effectively improves path reliability while reducing the delay jitter of frames. Compared with the traditional FRER mechanism, the proposed method reduces delay jitter by 15.6% when the network load is 0.9. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Higher levels of automated driving also require a more sophisticated environmental perception. Therefore, an increasing number of sensors transmit their data samples as frame bursts to other applications for further processing. As a vehicle has to react to its environment in time, such data is subject to safety-critical latency constraints. To keep up with the resulting data rates, there is an ongoing transition to a Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)-based communication backbone. However, the use of TSN-related industry standards does not match the automotive requirements of large timely sensor data transmission, nor it offers benefits on time-critical transmissions of single control data packets. By using the full data rate of prioritized IEEE 802.1Q Ethernet, giving time guarantees on large data samples is possible, but with strongly degraded results due to data collision. Resolving such collisions with time-aware shaping comes with significant overhead. Hence, rather than optimizing the parameters of the existing protocol, we propose a system design that synchronizes the transmission times of sensor data samples. This limits network protocol complexity and hardware requirements by avoiding tight time synchronization and time-aware shaping. We demonstrate that individual sensor data samples are transmitted without significant interference, exclusively at full Ethernet data rate. We provide a synchronous event model together with a straightforward response time analysis for synchronous multi-frame sample transmissions. The results show that worst-case latencies of such sample communication, in contrast to non-synchronized approaches, are close to their theoretical minimum as well as to simulative results while keeping the overall network utilization high.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The development of intelligent networked vehicles has put forward the requirements of high bandwidth, high real-time and high reliability for automotive network communication. Time sensitive network has become an important research content of vehicle Ethernet because of its high-precision synchronization, deterministic delay, redundant communication and other characteristics. This paper proposes an instruction delay time model in vehicle-mounted scenarios, and based on OMNeT++ simulation platform and improved CoRE4INET framework, combined with vehicle-mounted network traffic scenarios, designs network topology and simulation traffic, simulates and analyzes the performance of Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) mechanism, and compares it with Time Aware Shaper (TAS) mechanism. The simulation results show that compared with Time Aware Shaper mechanism, the Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding mechanism has better performance for aperiodic messages in the vehicle-based scenario designed in this paper, and can effectively reduce the end-to-end delay of messages. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Current safety-critical applications, found in domains such as automotive networking, automated industries, and control systems, require deterministic and latency-bounded end-to-end communication, currently not supported by best-effort networks. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is the most feasible approach to fulfill such requirements. Originating from the wired domain, their application to the wireless domain is now attracting attention. Besides some advances in time synchronization and scheduling, essential policies such as association with a wireless TSN (W-TSN), have not been explored. This paper analyses the necessary tools for a prospective client to accomplish association with the W-TSN without affecting ongoing time-sensitive traffic. We introduce three beacon-based methods to pre-synchronize and pre-schedule nodes willing to associate with the network. On top of the first full-stack Software Defined Radio (SDR) based IEEE802.11/Wi-Fi design, the proposed approaches are developed and tested in a real-world environment. A delay analysis shows a worst-case association delay of up to 1.8 s, and high accuracy synchronization on prospective clients’ association frame receptions, with 100% of on-time arrivals, even with challenging scheduling timeslots as short as 128 μs. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Since, over an in-vehicle network, the kind of traffic exceeds the number of priorities that IEEE 802.1TSN can support, utilization of in-class QoS control is inevitable. Thus, this paper evaluates the effect of the in-class control on QoS over Ethernet-based in-vehicle networks by experiment. This experiment assumes that each ECU can generate traffic of multiple priorities; it compares the QoS when QoS control is performed within the ECU (in-class control) or switch and when QoS control is used only at the switch. The experiments treat CBS, one of the QoS controls of IEEE 802.1TSN; it adopts the mean delay, maximum delay, and delay jitter as QoS parameters. The experimental results indicate that in-class control is only necessary when the network is heavily congested. The paper concludes that it is essential to maintain QoS for high-priority traffic when the network is highly congested by low-priority traffic. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Recently, there has been an interest from the automotive industry in a novel single-pair, half-duplex Ethernet multidrop provision (i.e., 10BASE-T1S), which relies on a coordinated channel access method provided by Physical Layer Collision Avoidance (PLCA). PLCA avoids frame collisions and provides bounded latency, while guaranteeing fairness among nodes and optimal bandwidth utilization. However, despite these advantageous features, PLCA is not aware of flow priorities and, consequently, does not provide priority-based Quality of Service (QoS). Thus, there is an opportunity for integrating QoS-aware schemes, such as the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)-based Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) algorithm, into PLCA. In this paper, we present modeling and analysis strategies using Network Calculus for integrating TAS with PLCA to support scheduled traffic, and we compare our modeling and analysis with a baseline work which previously modeled TAS for full-duplex point-to-point Ethernet only. We show that replacing full-duplex point-to-point links with half-duplex PLCA multidrop links still complies with end-to-end delay deadlines, while leading to a reduction of system costs due to the fewer number of Ethernet transceivers in a PLCA multidrop. Moreover, we also show that our results for TAS, when applied only on full-duplex point-to-point links, outperform the results of the baseline work in most use cases.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Vehicle infrastructure must address the challenges posed by today's advances toward connected and autonomous vehicles. To allow for more flexible architectures, high-bandwidth connections and scalability are needed to connect many sensors and electronic control units (ECUs). At the same time, deterministic and low latency is a critical and significant design requirement to support urgent real-time applications in autonomous vehicles. As a recent solution, the time-sensitive network (TSN) was introduced as Ethernet-based amendments in IEEE 802.1 TSN standards to meet those needs. However, it had hurdle to be overcome before it can be used effectively. This paper discusses the latest studies concerning the automotive Ethernet requirements, including transmission delay studies to improve worst-case end-to-end delay and end-to-end jitter. Also, the paper focuses on the securing Ethernet-based in-vehicle networks (IVNs) by reviewing new encryption and authentication methods and approaches. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) has been considered as a promising networking candidate for avionics systems due to its capability of deterministic communication. In such TSN-based avionics systems, the network scheduling enables the timely transmission of messages. However, this is insufficient to satisfy the real-time requirements of functions since functions involve the chain execution of several tasks where messages only serve for the inter-task communication. In order to enhance the functionality of TSN-based avionics systems, scheduling should be extended from the network level to the system level to coordinate message transmission with task execution. Then, how to efficiently implement the hybrid scheduling of tasks and messages becomes an important issue. In this article, we construct a novel hybrid scheduling framework for TSN-based avionics systems, which consists of system consistency constraints, in-loop function delay calculation, and two hybrid scheduling algorithms. Consistency constraints restrict the unexpected interaction of messages and tasks for hybrid scheduling to guarantee the system-level determinism. Function delay is the end-to-end delay of the task chain, and its calculation provides the optimization objective for hybrid scheduling indicated by two metrics. Scheduling algorithms improve solving efficiency and functional performance through the incremental strategies of message dynamic ordering and task-message rescheduling. Experimental results verify that, compared with existing scheduling work that considers the dependency of messages on tasks, our work can complete complex scheduling for large systems even with hundreds of functions and can reduce function delays by 69% in reaction delay and 37% in age delay.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - To guarantee real-time performance and quality-of-service (QoS) of time-critical industrial systems, time-aware shaper (TAS) in time-sensitive networking (TSN) controls frame transmission times in a bridged network using a scheduled gate control mechanism. However, most TAS scheduling methods generate schedules based on pre-configured routes without exploring alternatives for better schedulability, and methods that jointly consider routing and scheduling require enormous runtime and computing resources. To address this problem, we propose a TSN Scheduler with Reinforcement Learning-based Routing (TSLR) that identifies improved load balanced routes for higher schedulability with acceptable complexity using distributional reinforcement learning. We evaluate TSLR through TSN simulations and compare it against state-of-the-art algorithms to demonstrate that TSLR effectively improves TAS schedulability and link utilization in TSN with lower complexity. Specifically, TSLR shows a more than 66% increase in schedulability compared to the other algorithms, and TSLR's scheduling time is reduced by more than 1 h. It also shows flows’ transmission latency is less than 25% of their latency deadline requirement and reduces maximum link utilization by approximately 50%. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Designing and implementing distributed systems with real-time requirements quickly reveal the complexity of handling time and logic across multiple systems. As data traverse a network, it is subjected to variable delay due to interfering traffic and variable load on network components. This introduces an element of non-determinism in execution time for distributed algorithms, which translates into increased error logic and pessimistic worst-case estimates. Over the next few years, it is expected that Cyber-Physical Systems will see many new use cases, and the network connecting these will play an ever more important role. Combined with the onset of the fourth industrial revolution, IEEEs Time Sensitive Networking, IETFs Deterministic Networking, and 3GPPs Ultra Reliable Low Latency profile will play a vital role in realizing these systems. Coordination languages such as Lingua Franca can offer a substantial contribution to the design process and implementation of distributed systems such as Cyber-Phyiscal Systems, both through its model of computation which elevates time to a first-class citizen and with its support for distributed models. In this paper, we show that by introducing deterministic network channels with a fixed delay, the worst-case execution time is not increased whereas the variance in total execution time from start to finish is greatly reduced. For a coordination language such as LF, this means that we can analyze a system using much tighter delay bounds for network traffic, which in turn can yield better resource utilization.  © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - In feed-forward time-sensitive networks with Deficit Round-Robin (DRR), worst-case delay bounds were obtained by combining Total Flow Analysis (TFA) with the strict service curve characterization of DRR by Tabatabaee et al. The latter is the best-known single server analysis of DRR, however the former is dominated by Polynomial-size Linear Programming (PLP), which improves the TFA bounds and stability region, but was never applied to DRR networks. We first perform the necessary adaptation of PLP to DRR by computing burstiness bounds per-class and per-output aggregate and by enabling PLP to support non-convex service curves. Second, we extend the methodology to support networks with cyclic dependencies: This raises further dependency loops, as, on one hand, DRR strict service curves rely on traffic characteristics inside the network, which comes as output of the network analysis, and on the other hand, TFA or PLP requires prior knowledge of the DRR service curves. This can be solved by iterative methods, however PLP itself requires making cuts, which imposes other levels of iteration, and it is not clear how to combine them. We propose a generic method, called PLP-DRR, for combining all the iterations sequentially or in parallel. We show that the obtained bounds are always valid even before convergence; furthermore, at convergence, the bounds are the same regardless of how the iterations are combined. This provides the best-known worst-case bounds for time-sensitive networks, with general topology, with DRR. We apply the method to an industrial network, where we find significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art. IEEE

AB  - Modern vehicles are incorporating a wide array of technologies, leading to a substantial increase in data requirements. Concurrently, as vehicles integrate more Electronic Control Units (ECUs), there is a shift in their network architecture. Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) based on Ethernet is emerging as a key area of research to tackle these challenges. In this paper, we introduce both a region-based merge method and a period-based merge method. These approaches aim to reduce the overhead associated with Ethernet frame headers when transitioning CAN frames to Ethernet frames. This is especially pertinent for transmissions from the lower node of the End System (ES) to the upper Switch (SW). Moreover, our methods can efficiently manage the unavoidable delay time. The results and performance for each method is included.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - TSN has become the most popular technique in modern safety-critical automotive and industrial automation networks by providing deterministic transmission policies. However, the data of TSN messages may be affected by transient faults. IEEE 802.1CB, a reliability standard in TSN, protects against such faults by providing disjoint redundant routes for each stream. However, the unique assumption may present a new challenge, i.e., an inadequate number of redundant routes that may negatively impact stream scheduling. This article presents an offline fault-tolerant TSN scheduling approach that considers such impacts for real-time streams (such as time-trigger (TT) and audio video bridging (AVB) streams). Specifically, we intend to calculate the minimum upper bound number of disjoint routes required for each stream to meet the reliability requirements, subsequently enhancing the network's schedulability. We also propose a service degradation function for AVB streams when the network is under heavy load caused by redundant transmissions of TT streams. This function will maintain schedulability and reliability for AVB streams. Experiments with small- and large-scale synthetic networks show the efficiency. © 1982-2012 IEEE.

AB  - We demonstrate that, for periodic systems with offsets (tasks or flows of messages within a time-triggered network), the simulation cycle can be confined to the range of [0, hyperperiod) only under the condition that an idle point exists at the hyper-period. Furthermore, we establish that ensuring both (1) contention-freedom and (2) that no offset exceeds the value of the period minus duration, is a sufficient condition to guarantee the presence of an idle point at the hyper-period. Most contemporary methods aiming to eliminate latency are implicitly based on these properties and fail to propose a schedule if the input system does not allow a contention-free solution. Consequently, we propose a heuristic approach to scheduling periodic flows of frames within time-triggered networks. Our method focuses on minimizing latency, without necessitating a solution where every frame at every output port is contention-free, and it effectively manages the cyclicity problem.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - With the rising travel demand of crowds, urban road networks are under increasing pressure, which makes them progressively more fragile. Accurate identification of critical intersections is essential for urban management, resource allocation and traffic supervision. However, existing intersection evaluation methods fail to fully exploit transportation infrastructure, travel behavior and their synergistic relationships, resulting in coarse-grained and low-dynamic evaluation results. In this study, we develop an urban Intersection Evaluation framework from a Fine-grained Spatio-Temporal perspective (IE-FST). The framework is divided into three parts: fine-grained extraction of intersection information, multi-perspective assessment of node importance, and dynamic perception of spatio-temporal patterns in importance ranking. Specifically, IE-FST upgrades the intersection evaluation scale to turn-level, proposes the concept of Turning Sub-Node (TSN) and constructs a refined TSN topology network. Then, by finely extracting the network properties and mobility patterns of TSNs and mining the association patterns among TSNs, IE-FST proposes a Critical Fine-grained node Identification (CFI) algorithm to achieve a refined and dynamic evaluation of urban intersections. Finally, IE-FST analyzes the temporal characteristics and spatial distribution of TSN importance rankings, and provides traffic management measures for different types of TSNs to improve urban transport efficiency. Experiments are performed in Wuhan, China, and the results indicate that the proposed IE-FST framework achieves an accurate perception of urban intersections with high spatial and temporal resolution. This study promotes a better understanding of the synergistic relationships between crowd travel movements and urban transportation infrastructure, and provides theoretical support for infrastructure siting, refined traffic supervision, and rational resource allocation, thus contributing to the resilient and sustainable development of transportation systems and society. © 2023 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies

AB  - The virtual power plant is one of the key technologies for the integration of various distributed energy resources into the power grid. To enable its smooth and reliable operation, the network infrastructure that connects the components for critical communications becomes a research challenge. Current communication networks based on the traditional Ethernet and long-term evolution cannot provide the required deterministic low latency or reliable communication services. This paper presents a three-layer virtual power plant communication architecture with 5G and time-sensitive networking integrated networks for both determinism and mobility. The service types and traffic requirements of the virtual power plant are analyzed and mapped between 5G and time-sensitive networking to guarantee their quality of service. This paper proposes a semi-persistent scheduling with reserved bandwidth sharing and a pre-emption mechanism for time-critical traffic to guarantee its bounded latency and reliability while improving the bandwidth utilization. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed mechanism effectively reduces the end-to-end delay for both time-triggered traffic and event-triggered traffic compared with the dynamic scheduling method. For event-triggered traffic, the proposed mechanism has comparable end-to-end delay performance to the static scheduling method. It largely improves the resource utilization compared to the static scheduling method when the network load becomes heavy. It achieves an optimum performance tradeoff between delay and resource utilization when the percentage of the reserved resource blocks is 30% in the simulation. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - A digital twin technology is one emerging technique to mirror physical devices into the cyber world and then keep the real and digital worlds in synchronization, especially for industry and manufacturing. Regarding the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requirements of low latency and high reliability, IEEE Time Sensitive Networks (TSN) becomes one necessary and critical wired networking technology. This paper utilizes one famous digital-twin open-source project called Eclipse Ditto to monitor the TSN operations and provides the prioritized transmission capability. Based on our initial experimental results, adequate TSN policies can keep critical traffic flows as best effort as possible even in the competitive situation.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Static configurations in Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) using the Time-aware Shaper allow precise calculations of deterministic, tight bandwidth and latency guarantees for real-time industrial application streams. However, this static configuration makes introducing flexible changes to a TSN system at runtime very hard. Scenarios of adaptive TSN networks envision that the network configuration evolves with time in accordance with anticipated changes, such as the dynamicity of machine formations and machine reconfigurations. In this paper, we propose a notion of flexibility of scheduler configurations along a network path that facilitates introducing changes to TSN network configurations at runtime. Based on this notion, we develop and analyze algorithms to incrementally reconfigure TSN using the Time-Aware Shaper. These reconfigurations include determining the admissibility of new or changed streams that may possess individual deadlines. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Time-Aware Shaper(TAS), as an vitally important synchronous scheduling mechanism in Time-Sensitive Networks(TSN), is defined by the IEEE 802.1 Qbv [1] standard. TAS achieves non-waiting transmission of Time-Triggered(TT) streams by using Gate Control List(GCL). This paper analyzes the end-to-end(E2E) latency of time-sensitive flows when using the TAS mechanism. We built a testing platform using TSN switches and a professional tester. In the presence of background flows, we changed some key parameters and conducted multiple sets of tests. The test results indicate that when the TAS mechanism takes effect, it can achieve bounded latency for high priority traffic. In addition, ensuring the match between the arrival of high priority traffic and the GCL is a prerequisite for the high-performance operation of TAS. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Tight end-to-end worst-case delay bounds for periodic traffic streams are essential for time sensitive networks. In this paper, we provide an algorithm to compute a tight (and accurate) end-to-end worst-case bound by considering distinct topological patterns and the manner in which streams enter and leave switches. This refined analysis uses non-preemptive, strict-priority arbitration mechanism commonly deployed in Ethernet switches. Compared to the state-of-the-art that considers all higher and equal priority interference as contributing to the worst-case bound, we present an analytical approach for computing a tighter worst-case delay bound and prove through discrete event simulations that only a certain number of equal-priority interference streams can actually affect the worst-case case. Our results enable efficient resource allocation and have implications for online re-configuration mechanisms for time-sensitive factory communication systems. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Resource reservation is a fundamental mechanism for ensuring quality of service in time-sensitive networks, which can be decentralized by using reservation protocols. In the Ethernet technology Time-Sensitive Networking, this has been proposed in conjunction with the Credit-Based Shaper. For the reservation, the standards assume a maximum worst-case latency bound at each hop. However, we will show through formal analysis and simulation that these worst-case latency bounds are not safe. To face this, we propose an extension to the current standards to allow the reservation of time-sensitive traffic with reliable latency guarantees. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through simulations of both synthetic and industrial networks. Finally, by providing additional information about neighboring devices, we could further increase the maximum reservable traffic by up to 20% in our test cases.  © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Delay-constrained communications have attracted considerable recent attention because it holds the promise of playing a vital role in time sensitive networking (TSN) and deterministic networking (DetNet). In this paper, we investigate the tradeoff between power, latency, and throughput, which characterizes a fundamental performance limit of diversity enabled delay-bounded communications over fading channels. In particular, we are interested in a typical cross-layer scheduling policy, namely, the age-aware non-FIFO strategy, which is capable of satisfying a hard delay constraint by exploiting the physical-layer diversity methods. Saddle point approximation is adopted to obtain the analytical approximation of the average transmission power as a function of the throughput and the delay threshold normalized to the coherence time. This analytical expression characterizes the power-latency-throughput tradeoff of the diversity enabled delay-bounded communications over the fading channel. To validate our analysis, we present a discretization-based method to conduct the numerical calculation. The numerical results match well with the simulation results, which also shows that the approximation error will vanish with sufficiently small discretization granularity.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The emerging Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) is expected to meet a hard or probabilistic delay constraint that plays a key role in Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Deterministic Networking (DetNet). In this paper, we are interested in simple bounds for delay-constrained wireless communications with deterministic or even random packet arrivals. More specifically, we present a sufficient condition and derive a legitimate data arrival rate, with which the bounded delay can be guaranteed deterministically with an average power constraint. Our derived results will show that the delay-bounded data rate increases with the average power and the tolerated latency normalized to the coherent time. Furthermore, we derive the upper and lower bounds of the delay-violation probability (DVP) when the bounded delay condition cannot be satisfied. It is revealed that in the log coordinate, the DVP as a function of the normalized tolerated latency may enjoy a non-linear decay, with a decay rate that increases with the latency bound. This is in contrast to the large deviation based performance analysis that focuses on the low-latency transmission policies achieving linearly decayed DVP only. Our result demonstrates that the joint channel-aware and queue-aware scheduling may significantly reduce the DVP, compared to the single-layer approaches. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Most launcher networks are based on proprietary buses such as MIL-STD-1553B whose low bandwidth limits the introduction of new services of suitable characteristics. Ethernet technology, because of its low cost and high performance, has been considered an excellent candidate for its use in launcher networks. The real time Ethernet solutions based on the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards seem the most suitable because of its multi-vendor product characteristics. In this paper we propose a real time Ethernet solution for aerospace applications in which negligible jitter services has to be guaranteed. The proposed solution is based on the following TSN standards: IEEE 802.1AS/ASrev as synchronization protocol and 802.1Qbv-2015 for deterministic traffic scheduling. To improve both the bandwidth effective and the frame delay the solution is also based on a change in the management of the Priority Code Point field in IEEE 802.1Q standard. The optimal scheduling problem is formulated so as to minimize the makespan, defined as the time needed to deliver all of the messages of an elementary cycle. The problem has been resolved with the CPLEX solver and the proposed solution has been evaluated in terms of both delay and bandwidth effective by comparing its performance with the TTEthernet, FTTEthernet benchmark solutions. The obtained results in a real traffic scenario characterized by the set of messages of the VEGA launcher show how the proposed solution allows for the same performance of TTEthernet, i.e., the solution of proprietary and real-time Ethernet with better performance.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - With the continued evolution of autonomous driving, the communication demand for in-vehicle networks (IVNs) has dramatically increased, and the traditional IVN solutions have become ineligible for the needs of new in-vehicle applications. Time-sensitive network (TSN) with the characteristics of determinism, low latency, high reliability, large bandwidth, and open industry standards, has been considered as the most promising technology for the next-generation IVNs. This article summarizes the current state and methodologies of in-vehicle TSN research through the following five aspects: 1) Quality of Service (QoS) strategy; 2) reliability; 3) clock synchronization; 4) network planning; and 5) network management. The corresponding research priorities and technical challenges are also addressed, respectively.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - This article presents research on Ethernet networks with deterministic delays. The features of Time-Sensitive Networks and the key protocols contributing to time-delay-sensitive networks are considered. The principles of scheduling traffic with deterministic delays are reviewed. Determinism promotes efficient prediction of network behaviour and reduced latency as a consequence. Lack of predictability of networks increases the risk of information loss or delay, which can lead to lethal consequences. TSN that allow the use of synchronisation and the determinization of resulting delays provide an opportunity to enhance the security characteristics and resilience of hard time systems, something that Ethernet cannot fully guarantee. The cyclic scheduled traffic service algorithm we investigate allows prioritization of the traffic classes under study based on information criticality. The paper emphasizes the importance of prioritizing different traffic classes in queue scheduling. The necessity of correct synchronisation of streams and data delivery in the required time range is revealed, to ensure the reliability of production process management, based on the identification of Ethernet shortcomings.  © 2023 Author(s).

AB  - Time-sensitive network (TSN) guarantees deterministic delivery of traffic by prioritizing it differently. Commonly used traffic scheduling algorithm is time-aware shaper (TAS) combined with credit-based shaper (CBS). Aiming at the problem of excessive reserved bandwidth for stream reservation (SR) traffic during CBS scheduling, a traffic scheduling strategy based on load balancing was proposed. And the reserved bandwidth parameters of the SR traffic were optimized after completing the modeling of its delay problem. This strategy sliced and encapsulated the SR traffic packets into equal-length data frames at the end nodes and made them uniformly transmitted during the sending cycle. It reduced the end-to-end worst response time of the SR traffic due to packet congestion. After that the delay model was solved using simulated annealing algorithm to get the optimal reserved bandwidth. Simulation results showed that the proposed SR traffic scheduling strategy effectively reduced the reserved bandwidth and the delay of traffic transmission inside the switch on the basis of satisfying the traffic schedulability. © 2024 SPIE.

AB  - The GNU/Linux operating system (OS) is becoming more commonly used in real-time systems and has been modified with specific updates to provide faster and bounded response times as well as with fixed- and dynamic-priority real-time scheduling mechanisms. While the EDF-based scheduler ensures deadlines and temporal isolation for real-time tasks, it may not provide the level of determinism needed for modern applications that also have to consider complex jitter and multi-rate task dependencies. In this paper, we propose, implement, and evaluate an open-source, kernel-level time-triggered scheduling approach for Linux, examining the level of determinism achievable in terms of task execution and end-to-end latencies. We show that time-triggered scheduling in the Linux kernel achieves reduced latency and jitter for real-time applications when compared to the existing scheduling policies and user-space time-triggered implementations. Additionally, in terms of end-to-end communication latencies for distributed real-time applications, we compare a software-based IEEE 802.1Qvb time-aware gating implementation for time-sensitive networking (TSN) in which the time-triggered application schedule can be aligned to the network schedule to the standard Linux networking subsystem.  © 2023 ACM.

AB  - IEEE802.1Qbv (Time-aware Shaper: TAS) in IEEE802.1-Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has recently been applied within user networks (NWs) for realizing factory automation and remote control. TAS enables the coexistence of low-jitter traffic and best-effort traffic required in industrial NWs and enables deterministic control of communication latency. As mass customization matures, TAS is expected to extend its application coverage to not only user NWs but also wide-area NWs to enable real-time communication for remote control and cloud-based application use. TAS is TSN technology expected to be used for long-distance communications because it can guarantee maximum latency limits. However, designing a TAS schedule is known to be an NP-hard problem, which becomes more difficult as the number of forwarding hops increases. In this paper, we propose a method to solve the TAS design problem in large NWs by combining TAS design in smaller NWs; the NW is divided into several domains. We show that TAS solves the problem of large forwarding hop counts and improves schedulability when implemented in large NWs. This paper contributes to the realization of TAS in the wide-area NW, which has not been discussed so far.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is being widely investigated to provide Ethernet capabilities for in-vehicle backbone communication. However, the gate control list (GCL), as a simple mechanism for achieving timing determinism for safety-critical traffic (ST) frames with hard deadlines, is too rigid to handle the intrinsic timing uncertainty of automated driving systems (ADSs). Due to the complexity and the unpredictable operating environment, there can be delayed ST frames that can disrupt the solidly fixed timing behavior. In this work, we present one novel approach to effectively use bandwidth resources to deal with delayed ST frames, which cannot be handled by a traditional fixed GCL, and the discarding of them should be reduced to improve the system's integrity. An acceptance test is implemented to report to the application layer when an ST frame will miss its deadline and hence be rejected, i.e., prevented from entering the switch. To further improve the efficiency of bandwidth usage, we investigate how to improve the performance of the more important Class A frames in an audio-video-bridging (AVB) switch, which adopts a credit-based shaper mechanism, and we propose a constant bandwidth server to replace the credit-based shaper while taking fairness into consideration. Evaluation with extensive experiments shows that both resilience and efficiency of the TSN are significantly enhanced compared with a credit-based shaper, especially when the traffic load is relatively high. For the delayed ST frames and event-triggered traffic, our approach is able to schedule more than the solution using the AVB switch even with a high network load.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.

AB  - As a new computing mode, edge computing moves computing, storage and network resources to edge nodes close to users, providing lower latency and better user experience for various applications. At the same time, the rapidly growing number of Internet users and traffic scale have also posed many challenges to edge nodes in the network. Among them, the traffic shaping and scheduling mechanism of edge nodes has become a key research issue. In this paper, an edge node network model using Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) mechanism is considered, and the end-to-end delay bound of the interested flow in this scenario is derived using Network Calculus theory. Based on the theoretical analysis method proposed in this paper, the upper bound of the number of users that can be connected to the network and the lower bound of the service resources provided by edge nodes are obtained. The findings of this study provide practical implications for the planning and resource allocation of edge nodes in scenarios like industrial Internet.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Technological advancements in modern vehicles facilitate active research on the Ethernet-based Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) protocol to overcome the limitations of traffic processing in the traditional In-Vehicle Network (IVN) domain. Several TSN traffic processing studies focus on the process between the Switch (SW) or between the SW and End System (ES). However, traffic processing between the ES and subordinate nodes needs to integrate a TSN into an existing IVN. In this study, we compared the performance of the time-synchronized Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) approach and the non-time synchronized Asynchronous Traffic Shaper (ATS) approach (based on Token Bucket Emulation (TBE) and Length Rate Quotient (LRQ) algorithms) for traffic processing between the ES and subordinate nodes. The analysis revealed that the ATS approach based on the TBE algorithm exhibited the most stable performance in the given traffic model, whereas the TAS approach exhibited superior performance for high-priority traffic. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is gaining interest in the critical embedded networking community thanks to the various Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms that can be rolled out to offer different levels of determinism to flows in a switched Ethernet network. Among these standards, limited jitter flows can benefit from the Time Aware Shaper (TAS) which requires the deployment of the IEEE802.1AS synchronization. Indeed, TAS assumes a global time with a bounded drift between any two nodes. In this paper, we derive a refined and general mathematical model that offers upper and lower bounds on the worst-case precision that can be applied to different Ethernet technologies. Results for 100Base-T and 1000Base-T technologies are given. Both simulations and empirical measurements validate the almost two times closer upper bound we obtain compared to the state-of-the-art model. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The current automotive industry has a growing demand for real-time transmission to support reliable communication and for key technologies. The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) working group introduced standards for reliable communication in time-critical systems, including shaping mechanisms for bounded transmission latency. Among these shaping mechanisms, Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) and frame preemption provide deterministic guarantees for frame transmission. However, despite some current studies on the performance analysis of CQF and frame preemption, they also need to consider the potential effects of their combined usage on frame transmission. Furthermore, there is a need for more research that addresses the impact of parameter configuration on frame transmission under different situations and shaping mechanisms, especially in the case of mechanism combination. Firstly, this paper comprehensively reviews the schedulability analysis of the combined usage of CQF and frame preemption based on Compositional Performance Analysis (CPA). This paper summarizes the Worst-Case Responses (WCRs) of streams of each class under CQF with preemption. Secondly, this paper analyses the WCR under CQF with preemption. This analysis identifies the factors that influence the transmission latency for streams of each class and proposes several guidelines in parameter configuration under this mechanism combination. Then, this paper develops a scheduler named CQFP scheduler, enabling the computation of the WCR for all streams under CQF with preemption in different network scenarios. Finally, the paper conducts simulations to obtain the WCR under various configurations, validating the guidelines and the results obtained from the CQFP scheduler. This evaluation provides insights into the performance of the combination of CQF and preemption. The results can provide the network designers detailed guidelines in traffic class assignment and parameter configuration under CQF with preemption. © 2024 SAE International. All rights reserved.

AB  - In time-sensitive networks, bounds on worst-case delays are typically obtained by using network calculus and assuming that flows are constrained by bit-level arrival curves. However, in IEEE TSN or IETF DetNet, source flows are constrained on the number of packets rather than bits. A common approach to obtain a delay bound is to derive a bit-level arrival curve from a packet-level arrival curve. However, such a method is not tight: we show that better bounds can be obtained by directly exploiting the arrival curves expressed at the packet level. Our analysis method also obtains better bounds when flows are constrained with g-regulation, such as the recently proposed Length-Rate Quotient rule. It can also be used to generalize some recently proposed network-calculus delay-bounds for a service curve element with known transmission rate.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The time-sensitive network (TSN) utilizes gating technology to achieve mixed traffic transmission across the common network, replacing dedicated networks with time division multiplexing, simplifying the interconnection architecture. TSN fundamentally changes the uncertainty of traditional Ethernet through clock synchronization, traffic scheduling, and network configuration. TSN can meet the requirements of industrial communication for low delay, low jitter, and high-reliable data transmission. It is also fully compatible with the existing Ethernet system and is an important communication platform supporting the development of the industrial Internet. Time-triggered flow is the key flow responsible for transmitting real-time data in time-sensitive networks. Its transmission should strictly follow the gating schedule. Selecting different transmission paths will affect the success rate of scheduling. To solve the delay optimization problem of industrial time-triggered (TT) flow path selection, this paper proposes a novel forwarding mechanism for industrial TT flow, namely delay-aware differential multi-path forwarding (DA-DMPF). This mechanism first designs a multipath forwarding index based on sending delay and processing delay by analyzing the end-to-end delay, then converts the multipath forwarding problem into a 0-1 integer linear planning problem, and finally solves the forwarding path set of the stream through differential multipath forwarding algorithm to achieve low delay parallel transmission of the stream. The simulation results show that compared with load-balanced multi-path forwarding and Hop-Load forwarding mechanisms, this scheme reduces the end-to-end average delay of industrial TT flows by 22.55% and 17.32% respectively, meeting the low delay transmission requirements of TT flows. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Numerous time-sensitive applications are being made possible by the Internet of Things (IoT) phenomenon, which calls for real-time transmission to provide communication services. Applications that depend on low latency have been made possible because of the 5G Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) scenario. Widely regarded as a possible paradigm for achieving the deterministic transmission guarantees for 5G, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has gained much attention. TSN, on the other hand, is a hybrid traffic system that combines best-effort and time-sensitive traffic, necessitating efficient routing and frame preemption to provide a predictable and limited latency. On the other hand, time-sensitive and non-time-sensitive traffic optimization significantly broaden the issue area and increase the difficulty of establishing a solution. This research presents Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (EGCN-based DRL) solutions for the joint optimization problem in real-world communication contexts. The EGCN is included in deep reinforcement learning to obtain the network's spatial dependency and enhance the generalization performance of the suggested technique (DRL). Specifically, the EGCN approximates the graph convolution kernel using the first-order Chebyshev polynomial, which reduces the complexity of the algorithm and improves the feasibility of the task. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is also employed to hasten the convergence of the model training process. The objective of TSN is to provide deterministic and time-critical communication capabilities over Ethernet networks. TSN aims to enable reliable, low-latency, and synchronized communication between devices, ensuring that time-sensitive data and control messages are delivered with high precision and determinism. The suggested EGCN-based DRL algorithm surpasses cutting-edge techniques in terms of average end-to-end latency, and it also converges quickly, according to numerical simulations. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - A recent trend in embedded industry is to mix Integrated Modular Architectures (IMA) with Time Sensitive Networking (TSN). IMA principles allow resource sharing between numerous software functions in a deterministic way. On the other side TSN is considered a promising communication solution for distributed architectures. However, TSN has not been fully exploited with IMA, while it would meet the increasing communication needs due to the explosion of the number of on-board software functions. In order to better understand the challenges of designing IMA-TSN systems, this paper proposes a joint model which unifies task and message management and allows evaluation of end-to-end latency properties. The model is illustrated by simulation on an avionic case study. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In industrial applications, it is necessary to select different types of networks according to different communication requirements. To meet this requirement, a converged network of wired and wireless networks is frequently employed. Notably, fulfilling the end-to-end transmission requirements of converged networks is challenging. As a solution, converged-network scheduling methods have proved valuable. In this paper, a network scheduling method for the convergence of industrial wireless networks and time-sensitive networks is proposed. Additionally, the proposed method is tested and verified. The results show that the end-to-end average transmission delay is reduced and the jitter is acceptable. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - With the emergence of new space technologies, there is a need for more flexible and cost-effective aerospace intra-communication systems for both launchers and satellites. Traditional protocols like MILSTD-1553B are facing bandwidth limitations, while other alternatives like TTEthernet are expensive and inflexible. In this context, the use of Ethernet technologies is gaining popularity due to their high bandwidth and compatibility with Commercial Off-The Shelf (COTS) components, enabling cost savings and increased interoperability. This trend is particularly relevant for micro-launchers, where the payload size is relatively small, and the launching vehicles' reusability and quick production are key factors. As a result, manufacturers are attempting to adopt COTS components and the industry is shifting towards Ethernet-based intra-communication systems, as they offer a viable alternative to traditional protocols. Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a new technology that offers a promising alternative to these protocols, providing low-latency and high-bandwidth tailored to meet the needs of aerospace applications. One of the primary challenges of incorporating TSN into launchers networks is the configuration of the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. QoS is essential for ensuring that critical data is prioritized and delivered with low latency and zero jitter, while non-critical data is transmitted with lower priority. TSN provides a variety of QoS mechanisms, including Time Aware Shaper (TAS) and Queue-Based Scheduling (Qbv), which specify the queue-based scheduling mechanism to support the determinism required by applications such as aerospace. The TAS feature introduces time-controlled gating mechanisms to the egress port queues, but TSN does not immediately provide the same good temporal features as TTEthernet. Our study contributes significantly by introducing TSN-Lite, which incorporates only two Time Sensitive standards (IEEE 802.1ASrev and IEEE 802.1Qbv), optimizing them specifically for aerospace applications. We assess the TSN-Lite solution in a real network context using VEGA, a small launcher developed jointly by the Italian Space Agency and the European Space Agency. Furthermore, we perform a performance evaluation comparing the optimized TSN-Lite schedule with the optimized schedule of state-of-the-art solutions in the VEGA case study, demonstrating capability of TSN-Lite to approach TTethernet performance. © 2023 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

AB  - Factory automation is evolving from a hierarchical structure towards an interconnected architecture in which systems at different levels can communicate seamlessly with each other. This requires an appropriate replacement of proprietary fieldbus systems in the automation sector. A promising solution to implement cross-plane end-To-end real-Time capable communication between computing nodes is proposed in literature. The usage of Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) as the information model with the Publish-Subscribe (PubSub) communication mechanism in combination with Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is presented to fulfill the requirements for message transmission. In contrast to the state of the art of configuring fieldbus systems, the configuration of such a real-Time communication node has to be done manually. This process is complex, as deep knowledge in different domains is required. In this work we elaborate the requirements for such a communication node and present the resulting implementation challenges, which can be used as the basis for a configuration tool. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - With the rapid development of Industrial 4.0, massive emerging time-critical applications pose new demands for industrial networks, such as strict latency boundaries, ultra-reliable transmission, and so on. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is well suited for these demanding scenarios due to its support for deterministic transmission based on Ethernet. However, many use cases in real industrial scenarios involve non-TSN domains, and, thus, the network requires providing deterministic transmission across non-TSN domains to support them. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Software-Defined Time-Sensitive Networking (SD-TSN) framework that integrates the determinism of TSN and scalability of Software-Defined Networking (SDN). SD-TSN exploits the coordination between the coordinated controller and different domain controllers to bound non-deterministic queuing delays in a way that guarantees determinism. In particular, we designed a multi-domain time-aware traffic scheduling model, which harmonizes the time-aware shaper (TAS) in TSN and time-slots in non-TSN domains based on a global view, generating transmission schedules for each domain. A prototype testbed was built to conduct the experiments. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently achieve bounded delay and low delay variations in the transmission across non-TSN domains. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The uncertainty, aroused from the burst of stochastic traffic, will increase the delay of periodic traffic in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). To confront this challenge, a novel stochastic flow model based on the budget constraint uncertainty set is proposed to obtain interval prediction of future time points. Considering the coupling relationship between multiple periods, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is first established to cut the redundant part of the box set, and the budget constraints are gradually generated. In addition, with the consideration of the strong correlation between adjacent periods, another kind of budget constraint is further introduced into the mentioned uncertainty set such that the accuracy of the uncertainty set can be further improved. Based on the uncertainty set with budget constraints, a group of linear inequalities covering the traffic data of future first-time points is established and thus prediction interval can be given by solving the inequalities. Finally, the stochastic traffic prediction interval results of several time points in the future can be obtained via rolling prediction technology. Numerical tests are implemented with the actual data to verify the efficiency of the budget uncertainty set. © 2023 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.

AB  - In intelligent transportation systems, efficient traffic management and population monitoring is attributed to the real-time scheduling of multiple Transportation Big Data (TBD) flows, which strongly supported risk assessment and control during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as a complex and heterogeneous network, it is difficult to meet the priority and real-time requirements of multi-modal TBD flow scheduling. To improve the real-time performance of TBD flow scheduling, a scheme for Time-Triggered (TT) flow scheduling and Audio-Video Bridging (AVB) flow scheduling is proposed. First, an online scheduling method for TT flows (RFSD) is proposed, which uses Lion Swarm Optimization (LSO) algorithm for priority assignment and dynamic queues to adjust the scheduling order in real time. It ensures fairness in scheduling and effectively improves the utilization of time slot resources. Furthermore, an online scheduling method for AVB flows (RFSU) is proposed, which uses the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) to construct the utility function for evaluating the scheduling value of AVB flows, effectively increasing the throughput of AVB flows. Finally, extensive experiments show that RFSD increases successful scheduling by 22% over the PAS algorithm. Compared to the TTA algorithm, RFSU achieves a 24% reduction in average delay and a 27% reduction in jitter.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Time-sensitive software-defined networking (TSSDN) is an emerging technology that combines the real-time network configuration capabilities of software-defined networking (SDN) with the deterministic flow delivery capabilities of time-sensitive networking (TSN), making it ideal for use in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, as data flows generated by industrial applications grow exponentially, it is challenging to achieve low-latency and reliable data flow transmission at the same time in TSSDN due to the limited network resources. To address this issue, we propose the adoption of the frame replication and elimination for reliability (FRER) mechanism in TSSDN-based IIoT systems. However, it is important to acknowledge that the FRER mechanism introduces stress on the already restricted network resources by generating redundant paths. In light of this concern, we construct an end-to-end delay bound model and a reliability model to analyze this issue. To mitigate the stress imposed on the network, we formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the overall system utility while adhering to the transmission requirements of business flows and the limitations of hardware resources. Consequently, we devise an algorithm for reliability-enhanced flow routing and scheduling, which effectively solves the aforementioned optimization problem. To validate the effectiveness and performance of our proposed algorithm, we conduct numerical simulations on four data sets. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing methods.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - With the advancement of intelligence and networked automotive, the domain-centralized architecture, which employs time sensitive networking (TSN) as the inter-domain backbone network and control area network with flexible data rate (CAN-FD) as the intra-domain network, has garnered significant attention. However, cross-domain end-to-end communication involves multiple components, and significant disparities between TSN and CAN-FD render response time analysis within domain-centralized architecture for mixed-critical traffic exceptionally complex. In this paper, we develop a cross-domain with TSN and CAN-FD end-to-end response time evaluation tool, which analyzes the response time of mixed-critical traffic under different design options segment by segment. We specifically analyze the waiting times of different messages in the domain control unit when faced with the design options of one-to-one and multi-to-one conversion of CAN-FD and TSN frames. The proposed evaluation tool can be easily extended to different design options to support more application scenarios. Theoretical computational analysis and real hardware measurements show the effectiveness of our tool.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In-vehicle time-sensitive networking (TSN) delivers highly secure, ultralow latency deterministic communication for intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs). To tackle the traffic scheduling problem of in-vehicle TSN, this study establishes in-vehicle network topologies and flow models, abstracts the traffic scheduling problem as a job-shop scheduling problem (JSSP), and formulates a priority-based optimization function capable of various end-to-end (E2E) delay requirements. A joint routing and scheduling optimization strategy based on improved grey wolf optimization (IGWO) is proposed, which incorporates acrlong LF, historical experience learning, and acrlong TS operators to significantly enhance search capabilities and optimization efficiency. This strategy can rapidly solve large-scale in-vehicle network scheduling and generate scheduling results with outstanding delay performance. Dynamic routing that combines load-balanced and shortest path effectively minimizes interference between flows, further reducing E2E delay. Simulation experiments grounded in realistic ICV scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Furthermore, the simulation results verify the impact of flow period parameters and network topologies on E2E delay, offering guidance for in-vehicle TSN engineering design.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - With the expansion of Internet application fields, traditional Ethernet cannot meet the real-Time and deterministic requirements of time-and delay-sensitive applications. In order to solve this problem, the IEEE time-sensitive network group proposes a variety of Traffic shaping mechanisms. Among them, Asynchronous Traffic Shaper (ATS) scheduling can provide high link utilization and deterministic delay guarantee in the case of multiple traffic mixing in the network. And there is no need for strict clock synchronization between network devices. In order to solve the calculation problem of the ATS scheduling mechanism, this paper completes the theoretical delay upper bound calculation tool for flows with an ATS mechanism based on the delay analysis model in the Urgency-Based Scheduler (UBS). © 2023 IEEE.

Methods We retrospectively identified 16 713 patients hospitalized for TTS between July 2010 and March 2021 from the Japanese and results Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. Serious arrhythmias were defined as ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF), 2nd-/3rd-degree atrioventricular block (AVB), sick sinus syndrome (SSS), or unspecified arrhythmias requiring device treatment. Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared based on the occurrence of serious arrhythmias. The overall incidence proportion of serious arrhythmias was 6.2% (n = 1036; 449 VT/VF, 283 2nd-/3rd-degree AVB, 133 SSS, 55 multiple arrhythmias, 116 others), which remained stable over 11 years. The arrhythmia group was younger, more often male, and exhibited greater impairment in activities of daily living (ADLs) and consciousness than the non-arrhythmia group. Although crude in-hospital mortality was higher in the arrhythmia group (9.6% vs. 5.0%, P < 0.001), the significant association between arrhythmias and mortality disappeared after adjustment for confounders (odds ratio = 1.15, 95% confidence interval = 0.90–1.49). Meanwhile, age, sex, ADLs, consciousness level, and Charlson comorbidity index were significantly associated with mortality. In the arrhythmia group, 254 (24.5%) patients received pacemakers (18.4%) or defibrillators (6.1%), which were implanted at a median of 8 and 19 days after admission, respectively. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Conclusion Arrhythmias are not uncommon in TTS. Patients’ background characteristics, rather than arrhythmia itself, may be associated with in-hospital mortality.

AB  - The rapid development of intelligent rail transportation equipment is raising higher requirements for the real-time performance of Train Communication Network (TCN) data transmission. Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) has gained widespread attention in train communication due to its advantages of high transmission rates and deterministic latency. Firstly, for addressing the flow scheduling problem in TSN, a TCN topology model supports TSN is designed. It establishes a multi-objective flow scheduling model based on a priority strategy, aiming to minimize average response time and makespan while ensuring a scheduling success rate. Then, to solve the routing selection problem, a joint scheduling algorithm based on multi-level routing selection is adopted, providing feasible scheduling solutions. Finally, an improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) algorithm is introduced to iteratively and selectively optimize the scheduling solutions. This approach resolves the flow ordering problem while achieving optimization for the scheduling model. The feasibility of this scheduling approach is validated through simulations, and the results demonstrate significant advantages of the proposed model and algorithm in terms of scheduling success rate and real-time performance, providing effective solutions for flow scheduling in TCN. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) collectively defines a set of protocols and standard amendments that enhance IEEE 802.1Q Ethernet nodes with time-aware and fault-tolerant capabilities. Specifically, the IEEE 802.1Qbv amendment defines a timed-gate mechanism that governs the real-time transmission of critical traffic via a so-called Gate Control List (GCL) schedule encoded in each TSN-capable network device. Most TSN scheduling mechanisms are designed for homogeneous TSN networks in which all network devices must have at least the TSN capabilities related to scheduled gates and time synchronization. However, this assumption is often unrealistic since many distributed applications use heterogeneous TSN networks with legacy or off-the-shelf end systems that are unscheduled and/or unsynchronized. We propose a new scheduling paradigm for heterogeneous TSN networks that intertwines a network calculus worst-case interference analysis within the scheduling step. Through this, we compromise on the solution’s optimality to be able to support heterogeneous TSN networks featuring unscheduled and/or unsynchronized end-systems while guaranteeing the real-time properties of critical communication. Within this new paradigm, we propose two solutions to solve the problem, one based on a Constraint Programming formulation and one based on a Simulated Annealing metaheuristic, that provide different trade-offs and scalability properties. We compare and evaluate our flexible window-based scheduling methods using both synthetic and real-world test cases, validating the correctness and scalability of our implementation. Furthermore, we use OMNET++ to validate the generated GCL schedules. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Routing, working with scheduling cooperatively to ensure the deterministic low-latency communication, plays a critical role in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). The multi-level spatial correlation among network nodes may greatly impact the forwarding paths of flows and is yet to be well investigated to improve the paths selecting process. In this letter, hypergraph is first introduced to model the time-sensitive networks, which can capture group features and higher-dimensional relationships for nodes. Then, the forwarding process for flows on a hyperedge and the end-to-end hyperpaths of flows are analyzed and studied. Finally, a hypergraph-based routing algorithm is designed to provide efficient routing decisions for time-sensitive flows. Simulation results show that the proposed routing algorithm can enhance the efficiency of paths planning and provide satisfiable global schedule for time-sensitive networks.  © 1994-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we identify that the existing end-to-end data propagation delay analysis for distributed embedded systems can calculate pessimistic (over-estimated) analysis results when the nodes are synchronized. This is particularly the case of the Scheduled Traffic (ST) class in Time-sensitive Networking (TSN), which is scheduled offline according to the IEEE 802.1Qbv standard and the nodes are synchronized according to the IEEE 802.1AS standard. We present a comprehensive system model for distributed embedded systems that incorporates all of the above mentioned aspect as well as all traffic classes in TSN. We extend the analysis to support both synchronization and non-synchronization among the ECUs as well as offline schedules on the networks. The extended analysis can now be used to analyze all traffic classes in TSN when the nodes are synchronized without introducing any pessimism in the analysis results. We evaluate the proposed model and the extended analysis on a vehicular industrial use case. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - The emerging applications in vertical industries generate diverse time-critical traffic flows with bounded delay requirements. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) enhances the traditional Ethernet by using Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), providing delay guarantees for traffic flow transmission. However, the fixed scheduling granularity of physical queues in TAS can bring an obstacle for the flow isolation in per-flow scheduling, such as the complex computing and configuration. This paper proposes a method of Virtual Queues-based Time-Aware Traffic Scheduling (VQ-TATS) in Software-Defined Time-Sensitive Networking (SD-TSN). SD-TSN is a networking architecture that integrates the determinism guarantees of TSN and flexible network resource allocation of Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Through the capability of SD-TSN, the physical queues resource is virtualized for VQ-TATS. VQ-TATS includes the VQ clustering and VQ mapping stages. VQ clustering aggerates virtual queues to adapt to the scheduling granularity of TAS. VQ mapping builds the relationship between virtual and physical queues and generates the gate control list of TAS. The clustering and mapping algorithms are also designed to perform VQ-TATS. The evaluation in an industrial control use case shows the effectiveness of the proposed method in schedulability and runtime.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Converged networks require new service protection functionalities to ensure reliable and robust communications. This paper provides insights into the evolution of deterministic communication and the importance of service protection in converged networks. We examine the per-packet-based replication/elimination service protection mechanism, ongoing standardization efforts, and potential areas for further development. We also explore the practical implementation of the service protection technique in real network scenarios, including its impact on operation and maintenance. The main contributions of the paper are: (1) new cloud-specific extensions to the service protection functionality, (2) introduction of redundancy domains to avoid replication/elimination-related failure propagation, (3) new service protection specific extensions to the network operation toolset, and (4) new diagnostic capabilities to monitor the healthiness of the service protection functionalities. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness and operation of newly proposed service protection extensions based on experimental results from a real 5G testbed.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - With the continuous upgrading of communication networks and the development of artificial intelligence technology, improving the performance of communication networks by realizing their intelligence is a widely researched direction. For example, reinforcement learning is utilized for time-sensitive network (TSN) configuration to enhance its adaptability to dynamic environments. However, the training of DRL algorithms suffers from a time-consuming problem, which runs counter to the delay sensitivity of communication networks. Therefore, we utilize network prediction algorithms to assist reinforcement learning by proposing an improved DRL algorithm, called preDQN, which will be used to help agents explore the environment more efficiently and reduce the time they spend in the training process compared to the agent's blind exploration behavior in the DRL algorithm. Experimental validation has been carried out in a simulation environment and the experimental results show that the improved reinforcement learning algorithm preDQN can significantly improve its convergence. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Over the last years, we have seen the emergence of (hyper-)distributed applications, which tend to be provisioned over resources that span IoT devices, IoT gateways, and compute nodes from edge computing infrastructures. The deployment and orchestration of such services benefits from types of IoT middleware, known as Virtual Objects (VOs). However, in order to reap the benefits of VOs, low-latency communication is required between the IoT devices and their associated VOs. To this end, we utilize Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), which has paved the way for the timely delivery of delay-sensitive traffic. Our main contribution lies in the design and evaluation of a TSN scheduler, which is compliant with the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS). In this respect, we present a constraint programming formulation for the TSN scheduling problem at hand. A salient feature of the proposed TSN scheduler is its ability to compute the schedule periods both efficiently and at small time-scales. The latter is of crucial importance for dynamic conditions, where the association of IoT devices and their virtual counterparts is subject to change. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - With the vigorous development of automobile industry, in-vehicle network is also constantly upgraded to meet data transmission requirements of emerging applications. The main transmission requirements are low latency and certainty especially for autonomous driving. Time sensitive networking (TSN) based on Ethernet gives a possible solution to these requirements. Previous surveys usually investigated TSN from a general perspective, which referred to TSN of various application fields. In this paper, we focus on the application of TSN to the in-vehicle networks. For in-vehicle networks, we discuss all related TSN standards specified by IEEE 802.1 work group up to now. We further overview and analyze recent literature on various aspects of TSN for automotive applications, including synchronization, resource reservation, scheduling, certainty, software and hardware. Application scenarios of TSN for in-vehicle networks are analyzed one by one. Since TSN of in-vehicle network is still at a very initial stage, this paper also gives insights on open issues, future research directions and possible solutions.  © 2013 China Institute of Communications.

AB  - Network Calculus (NC) is a method for providing certification evidence in networked systems, ensuring proper functioning of time-critical traffic. Traditional NC analyses focus on feedforward networks that are networks without cyclic dependencies. However, some methods, like the fix-point method and turn prohibition, apply NC to non-feedforward networks but exhibit limitations in stability, adaptability, and flexibility. We propose an alternative method, service partitioning, supported by theorems and lemmas, to address these limitations. Service partitioning breaks cyclic dependencies in non-feedforward networks using a breaking method that leverages Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms (Weighted Round-Robin, Static Priority, Time-Aware Shaper), by assigning flows that form cycles to distinct buffer with dedicated service allocations. This method offers enhanced flexibility by allocating different network resources to buffers based on multi-class scheduling during the breaking process. In contrast to existing methods, service partitioning does not require rerouting or additional hardware and avoids deriving invalid solutions. The paper investigates the performance of service partitioning in terms of flexibility, result tightness, adaptability, and stability to show that service partitioning is superior to existing methods. One limitation of service partitioning is that it cannot fully break cyclic dependencies in some scenarios, requiring the assist from solving methods, which can be used to apply network calculus to networks with cyclic dependencies. However, when combined with solving methods, service partitioning can still improve solution quality, reducing potentially invalid results in simulated ring networks by over 30% compared with results derived by solving methods alone.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) aims to provide deterministic communications over Ethernet. The main characteristics of TSN are bounded latency and very high reliability, thus complying with the strict requirements of industrial communications or automotive applications, to name a couple of examples. In order to achieve this goal, TSN defines several scheduling algorithms, among them the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), which is based on time slots and Gate Control Lists (GCLs). The configuration of network elements to allocate time slots, paths, and GCLs is laborious, and has to be updated promptly and in a dynamic way, as new data flows arrive or disappear. The IEEE 802.1Qcc standard provides the basis to design a TSN control plane to face these challenges, following the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm. However, most of the current SDN/TSN control plane solutions are monolithic applications designed to run on dedicated servers, and do not provide the required flexibility to escalate when facing increasing service requests. This work presents (Formula presented.) TSN-CP, an SDN/TSN microservices-based control plane, based on the 802.1Qcc standard. Our architecture leverages the advantages of microservices, enabling the control plane to scale up or down in response to varying workloads dynamically. We achieve enhanced flexibility and resilience by breaking down the control plane into smaller, independent microservices. The performance of (Formula presented.) TSN-CP is evaluated in a real environment with TSN switches, and various integer linear problem solvers, running over different computing platforms. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - With the development of the energy Internet, the regulation scale of various control services of electric power is becoming more and more refined, and it is necessary to provide reliable communication support in an open and shared environment. Due to the advancement of Layer 2 Ethernet technology, power networks based on time-sensitive networking (TSN) functions have emerged, and 5G networks have been applied in more and more scenarios due to their low latency and high reliability technical characteristics. To this end, it provides end-to-end deterministic transmission guarantee across 5G and TSN. Real-time protection of power services such as power distribution automation, power consumption information collection, and intelligent power load control. In this paper, a cross-domain scheduling and routing method for control services is designed in a 5G+TSN network. Aiming at the problem of excessive scheduling overhead in power data transmission, a dynamic traffic balance management scheme based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) was established for the first time. Next, this joint scheduling problem is solved by proposing an algorithm combining random and local search of multi-objective simulated annealing (called SA-JPRS algorithm), and finally it can be observed that the algorithm proposed in this study can effectively balance load balancing and Transfer These two power transfer metrics are compared to other systems through simulation to determine how fast or slow the latency is. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has become a popular technique for providing deterministic transmission policies in the modern Internet of Things (IoT). To simplify configuration complexity and enhance dynamic and flexible behavior in TSN, IEEE 802.1Qch (Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding, CQF) was released. However, messages may encounter transient faults during transmissions, which can influence schedulability and reliability. To protect against such faults, re-transmitting incorrectly received messages is a common approach. However, unlimited re-transmissions can cause a temporary and rapid increase in network load, leading to situations where some streams cannot be transmitted within their deadlines, decreasing the reliability of time-critical streams. This presents a new challenge for performing re-transmissions in TSN. In this paper, we address this issue and present a re-transmission-based fault-tolerant scheduling technique for TSN (called ReT-FTS). Each stream is limited to a minimum number of re-transmissions while maintaining reliability requirements. Therefore, we develop analysis techniques for quantifying network reliability in various scenarios, including those in which streams are dropped or not dropped. We then demonstrate that the reliability does not increase when streams are dropped. We also conduct extensive experiments with synthetic and realistic networks in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) realizes high bandwidth and time determinism for data transmission and thus becomes the crucial communication technology in time-critical systems. The Gate Control List (GCL) is used to control the transmission of different classes of traffic in TSN, including Time-Triggered (TT) flows, Audio-Video-Bridging (AVB) flows, and Best-Effort (BE) flows. Most studies focus on optimizing GCL synthesis by reserving the preceding time slots to serve TT flows with the strict delay requirement, but ignore the deadlines of non-TT flows and cause the large delay. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive scheduling method to enhance the real-time scheduling of AVB flows while guaranteeing the time determinism of TT flows. This method first optimizes GCL synthesis to reserve the preceding time slots for AVB flows, and then introduces the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) method to further improve the transmission of AVB flows by considering their deadlines. Moreover, the worst-case delay (WCD) analysis method is proposed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the transmission of AVB flows compared to the state-of-the-art methods. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - 5G+ deterministic network plays important role in the power system. Time sensitive network(TSN) related technologies meet the real time transmission of time-triggered power flows. In this paper, we firstly propose a network calculus based model for analyzing network maximum delays, which utilizing service curves and arrival curves to determine the upper threshold of TSN end-to-end delays by the time-aware shaper (TAS) mechanism. This model simplifies the evaluation of delay performance when compared to conventional random queuing methods. Secondly, since the service curve relies on the gate control list (GCL) configuration, this requires accurately calculating gate durations for different service flows and the precise open/close time for each queue. To tackle this challenge, this paper presents a GCL adaptive adjustment algorithm, which can identify the minimum of maximum delays by configuring gating parameters optimally. Thirdly, we use Matlab to analyze high-priority flow maximum delays across different GCL configurations, examining the effects of service flows, overlap times, gate open durations, and time intervals. Furthermore, we employ the OMNeT++ platform to conduct network simulations under predefined GCL gating settings. The results show that high-priority flows maintain an end-to-end delay below the optimized maximum delay value, consistently confirming the effectiveness of the proposed TSN delay analysis model and GCL adaptive adjustment algorithm.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents guaranteed Latency Based Forwarding (gLBF), a solution that allows for the delivery of packets with end-to-end latency guarantees and that provides per-hop bounded latency with zero jitter. gLBF combines the benefits of earlier algorithms, Urgency-Based Scheduling and Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding, while avoiding their respective downsides. Specifically, gLBF does not need to maintain per-flow state at forwarding devices and does not require strict clock synchronization across the network. As a result, gLBF results in network deployments of significantly reduced complexity and lower cost than previous solutions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) strives to provide an ultralow-latency real-time deterministic network for time-critical traffic using the time-aware shaper (TAS) mechanism. For this purpose, methods for routing and scheduling the time-critical flows must be specified. However, this is an NP-hard problem. Although several prior studies have suggested constraint programming (CP)-based approaches, these methods fail to provide a reasonable runtime due to the complexity of the problem. Motivated by this, we propose a TAS co-optimization (TACO) framework that solves the TAS scheduling and routing problem in TSN with a reasonable runtime. As an alternative to CP-based approaches, TACO considers a metaheuristic approach to co-optimize routing, scheduling order, and transmission timing. However, joint optimization through a metaheuristic algorithm is challenging due to the heterogeneous search spaces of the subproblems. Therefore, TACO carefully integrates the search spaces into a single domain and optimizes routing and TAS scheduling jointly with its heuristic algorithm. We evaluate TACO in various industrial networking scenarios to demonstrate that TACO achieves up to an 88% increase in the scheduling success rate with a good convergence rate and an overall low latency/jitter compared to other approaches.  © 2014 IEEE.

Due to the spatial and networked nature of public transportation, revealing the spatial configuration and structural disparities between public transportation supply and demand networks (TSN and TDN) can provide significant insights into complex urban systems. In this study, we explored the spatial configuration and structural disparities between TSN and TDN in the complex urban environment of Beijing. By constructing subdistrict-scale TSN and TDN using urban public transportation operation data and mobile phone data, we analyzed the spatial characteristics and structural disparities of these networks from various dimensions, including global indicators, three centralities, and community structure, and measured the current public transportation supply and demand matching pattern in Beijing. Our findings revealed strong structural and geographic heterogeneities of TSN and TDN, with significant traffic supply–demand mismatch being observed in urban areas within the Sixth Ring Road. Moreover, based on the percentage results of supply–demand matching patterns, we identified that the current public transportation supply–demand balance in Beijing is approximately 64%, with around 18% of both excess and shortage of traffic supply. These results provide valuable insights into the structure and functioning of public transportation supply–demand networks for policymakers and urban planners; these can be used to facilitate the development of a sustainable urban transportation system. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a promising real-time network technology that has deterministic delay and jitter guarantee capabilities. However, TSN flow scheduling faces challenges in the multi-level topology due to the cooperative scheduling requirements of multiple data flows, which are abstracted as TSN chain flows. In this paper, we present an efficient scheduling approach, namely TSN Chained Flow Scheduling (TCFS), which is utilized to globally schedule chain flows in the multi-level topology. To obtain optimal TCFS scheduling results, we design the scheduling constraints and propose an offline algorithm to efficiently schedule chain flows in the multi-level topology. Based on offline scheduling results, we further propose a heuristic method that includes time-tabling and sequencing algorithms to improve the dynamic scheduling performance. Experimental results show that the TCFS approach efficiently improves the schedulability for chain flows, as compared with benchmarks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) has emerged as a promising standard for real-time domains. Efficiently determining critical configuration parameters for latency guarantees for time-critical flows remains an open question. Current configuration approaches rely on optimization methods with real-time performance analysis feedback to ensure deadline quality-of-service requirements. However, the ex-post verification-based optimization methods require exhaustive traversal of the entire network search space, leading to significant time consumption. This article proposes a novel, fast, and scalable deadline-aware method for configuring minimum bandwidth allocation for stream reservation (SR) classes in the TSN network, while guaranteeing deadline requirements for all time-critical traffic. We provide formal proof of our approach, which configures critical parameters in a real-time network with prior performance guarantees, thus reducing computational complexity. The analytical method is evaluated on synthetic cases, comparing it with state-of-the-art solutions to demonstrate validity and correctness. Moreover, an adapted real-world case shows the method's scalability, and minimum bandwidth reservations with guaranteed local deadlines for SR classes on all egress ports of the network can be achieved in seconds.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Distributed real-time systems (DRTSs) composed of many embedded end-systems have been widely adopted in the industrial fields. Time-sensitive networking (TSN), as a promising communication infrastructure for DRTS, has shown great potential in industry and academia. TSN assumes that an end-system can release critical tasks to process critical packets strictly according to the prescheduled time. Unfortunately, two factors currently damage this assumption: 1) the jitter caused by system architecture during task release, task execution, and packet transmission; and 2) a TSN schedule result may exceed the execution capability of the end-system and cause conflicts. This article proposed deterministic chip (DetChip), a system-on-chip capable of deterministically implementing the TSN schedule result. DetChip supports time-triggered task release, time-predictable task execution and precise network transmission. Based on DetChip, this article first formalizes the execution capability of the end-system as end-system constraints (ECs). Existing TSN scheduling algorithms integrating ECs can solve conflicts by co-scheduling end-systems and the TSN network. Compared with previous works, DetChip only introduces few clock cycles jitter for critical task execution according to the TSN schedule result. The proposed ECs obtain 2× - 8× more conflict-free solutions for advanced scheduling algorithms with a linear increase in time overhead. Compared with the general end-system, DetChip can reduce 6× - 20× processing jitter to achieve better clock synchronization.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Industry 4.0 involves the networking of production equipment. This can be achieved thanks to the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) set of network standards. However, this new paradigm brings new challenges because TSN features optimization relies on the dynamic characteristics of the underlying communication network (e.g., network topology, routing strategy, critical flows requirements, etc.). This paper focuses on the case of the IEEE 802.1Qbv standard by exploring the applicability of a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach in order to reduce the configuration time of the TSN-specific parameters, compared to exact or heuristic methods. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The selection of a Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) shaping mechanism is a crucial design decision that impacts the Quality of Service (QoS) of applications and configuration complexity. However, current research has mainly evaluated TSN shapers individually, despite them being designed to work together in an egress port. Hence, the lack of investigation of the mixed TSN shaping mechanism is a major limitation of the current state of the art. Combined TSN traffic shaping provides greater flexibility to improve QoS than individual shapers, making it particularly beneficial for real-time applications. This paper aims to bridge this research gap by implementing the Asynchronous Traffic Shaper (ATS) in a plug-and-play manner, enabling its use individually or in combination with other TSN shapers. We propose various models of mixed TSN shaper architectures and implement the frozen and non-frozen credit behavior of the Time Aware Shaper (TAS) + Credit Based Shaper (CBS) during the guard band (GB) using OMNeT++. Furthermore, we compare the simulation results of ATS and CBS with the Network Calculus (NC) upper bounds. Our results indicate that the simulated delays (SMDs) were significantly lower than the theoretical worst-case delays (WCDs) obtained from the NC, indicating the need for tighter theoretical upper bounds, particularly for higher network loads. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide simulation-based performance analysis of the combined TAS+ATS+CBS and TAS+ATS+Strict Priority (SP) architecture. Overall, this paper highlights the benefits of combining TSN shapers and encourages further research into the potential advantages of utilizing multiple shapers simultaneously to decrease reliance on TAS and CBS.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Wireless Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN) are needed to fulfill the requirements of real-time applications in areas where wired connections are not feasible. Wireless TSN combines the real-time capabilities of TSN with the flexibility of wireless connectivity opening a path for new use cases while providing determinism to time-critical scenarios such as autonomous vehicles. Industrial automation is integrating TSN with various wireless technologies such as WiFi, 4G, and 5G. This paper presents an ongoing work which aim is to experimentally analyze the performance of TSN when integrated with 4G, 5G, and WiFi in real-world scenarios.

AB  - Background - Patients suspected of platelet function defects represent a diagnostic challenge for the clinical laboratory, mainly due to the complexity and poor standardization of screening methods. We compared a new flow-based chip-equipped point-of-care (T-TAS) device with lumi-aggregometry and other specific tests. materials and methods - The study included 96 patients suspected of platelet function defects and 26 patients referred to hospital for an evaluation of residual platelet function while on antiplatelet therapy. results - Forty-eight of 96 patients displayed abnormal platelet function by lumi-aggregometry, and 10 of them had defective granule content and were classified as δ-storage pool disease (δ-SPD). T-TAS compared favorably with lumi-aggregometry in detecting the most severe forms of platelet function defects (i.e., δ-SPD) [test agreement (lumi-light transmission aggregometry [lumi-LTA] vs T-TAS) for the δ-SPD subgroup was 80% and K CHOEN 0.695. T-TAS was less sensitive to milder platelet function defects (i.e., primary secretion defects [PSD]). Concerning patients on antiplatelets, test agreement (lumi-LTA vs T-TAS) in detecting patients who were responders to this therapy was 54%; K CHOEN 0.150. discussion - The results indicate that T-TAS can detect the more severe forms of platelet function defects such as δ-SPD. There is limited agreement of T-TAS with lumi-aggregometry in identifying responders to antiplatelets. However, this poor agreement is commonly shared by lumi-aggregometry and other devices owing to the lack of test specificity and of prospective data from clinical trials linking platelet function with therapeutic efficacy. © SIMTIPRO Srl.

AB  - Vehicle time-sensitive communication (VTSC) is an emerging paradigm where the Time-Sensitive Networking together with V2X provides connected vehicle with deterministic and low communication latency. Scheduling is a critical step to realize the determinism. Recently, as the scale and variety of VTSCs increase, the requirements of simultaneously achieve multicast supportment, short runtime, dynamic schduling ability and low resource overhead challenge the traditional TSN scheduling algorithms. This article proposes a scheduling scheme with multiple stages to achieve both efficient and rapid scheduling. This article first formulates the joint routing and scheduling problems by proposing a cluster-Integer Linear Programming (CILP). It aims to accelerate the static scheduling and realize real-time response for dynamic incremental scheduling. An improved topology pruning method and a clustering-aggregation ILP procedure are presented. Then, since the dynamic scheduling will gradually reduce the resource utilization, this article proposes an adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) to rapidly perform the resource optimization. The crossover operator, mutation operator, adaptive probability and fitness function are designed, supporting multicast TSN flows. Finally, this article conducts extensive simulations to validate the proposed algorithms. The results show that, comparing with traditional methods, the proposed CILP method can reduce the average runtime by up to 86.7% for static scheduling and realize real-time dynamic scheduling. The proposed AGA method can reduce the resource optimization runtime by up to 70% while improving the schedulability. The overall multi-stage scheduling mechanism could satisfy the VTSC scheduling requirements.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In time-sensitive networks, the frames of time-triggered (TT) flows need to be transmitted in scheduled slots. To avoid the interference of frames from other flows to the frames of the TT flows, guard bands are generally reserved prior to scheduled slots. The time-sensitive networking (TSN) standard, IEEE 802.1Qbu, specifies a frame preemption model that enables frames of TT flows (preemption frames) to preempt frames of other flows (preempted frames). According to this model, preempted frames are divided into fragments that are transmitted in the gaps of preemption frames. Consequently, the IEEE 802.1Qbu model reduces the guard band from the longest Ethernet frame (typically 1518 bytes) to 123 bytes, which improves the bandwidth utilization and delay performance of preempted frames without causing frame disorder. However, in scenarios in which the preempted frame load is heavy, and the length is short, numerous guard bands smaller than 123 bytes are generated. These guard bands prevent the IEEE 802.1Qbu model from transmitting preempted frame fragments, resulting in a considerable decrease in bandwidth utilization. To solve this problem, we propose a novel frame preemption model without guard bands, based on a padding and splicing mechanism. While ensuring that preemption frames are transmitted according to scheduled slots, this model can transmit preempted frames within arbitrary byte gaps based on the schedule without obtaining the length of the preempted frames in advance. We compared the transmission-delay performance of the proposed model with that of the IEEE 802.1Qbu model using a theoretical analysis. The evaluation results obtained from heavily loaded preemption frame scenarios revealed that the proposed model improved link utilization by 32.8% relative to the IEEE 802.1Qbu model and reduced the transmission delay by more than one order of magnitude. Moreover, when the IEEE 802.1Qbu model fails, the proposed model still transmits 60% of preempted frames. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - 5G and cloud computing are set out to address various business needs, often related to the deployment of IoT-enabled applications across the compute continuum. However, the provision of such hyper-distributed applications is far from trivial, due to various interoperability and convergence aspects. In this respect, we introduce a software stack (VOStack) for IoT-oriented virtual objects in order to remove existing openness and interoperability barriers in the convergence of IoT technologies. We elaborate on physical convergence aspects with an emphasis on networking functionalities in order to address communication issues between IoT devices, IoT gateways, and compute nodes that host virtual objects. In particular, we present control plane functionalities, within the VOStack, for time-sensitive networking (TSN) and reactive routing in order to ensure the timely delivery of time-sensitive data and also alleviate any potential implications due to intermittent connectivity or mobility.  © 2023 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Real-time communications characterized by low-latency, deterministic, and reliable behavior are crucial for the advancement of emerging technologies. Consequently, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has been developed to address the distinct demands of sectors such as automation and autonomous vehicles applications. This is currently achieved through various methods that emphasize the scheduling of critical data traffic. However, many of these methods determine routes independently, potentially impacting the schedulability of transmissions. Additionally, there is a noticeable lack of emphasis on the scheduling and routing of low-priority transmissions within TSN. In this paper, we introduce the Optimized Hybrid Deterministic Scheduling and Routing (OHDSR) approach. This method takes into account the priority of communications to jointly optimize the scheduling and routing of Time-Triggered (TT) communications, while also catering to low-priority Best-Effort (BE) communications. Extensive experimental evaluations show the high efficiency of our proposed method. It ensures not only the prompt delivery of TT communications but also the delivery of BE communications within suitable time frames, with a maximum difference of 14.29% from TT communications, meeting their respective deadlines. Moreover, the evaluation demonstrates the high scalability of the proposed approach, providing improved response times compared to the latest work for both routing and scheduling.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Cyber-physical power system (CPPS) stability is severely affected by the communication network performance due to cyber-physical interdependence. Thus, uncertain cyber-physical coordinated attacks (CPCA) pose more significant threats to CPPS than physical attacks. However, the defense strategies in recent works assume real-Time and reliable transmission under an ideal cyber-Attack, leading to inaccurate cyber-physical interdependence modeling. Therefore, the strategies are ineffective against uncertain CPCA. This paper proposes a hierarchical CPPS network architecture that integrates time-sensitive networking (TSN) to improve resilience against uncertain CPCA. To model the uncertain CPCA, a coordinated N-K ambiguity set is proposed considering all possible link failures on both cyber and physical layers. For the cyber layer, we propose a joint routing-scheduling model of TSN-based network to support deterministic and reliable data transmission, which improves the accuracy of cyber-physical interdependence. A distributionally robust coordinated defense (DRCD) strategy integrated with cyber-physical interdependence is then proposed to mitigate the priority-based load shedding considering the uncertainties of CPCA. The formulated DRCD strategy is linearized and transformed into a tri-level optimization problem which is efficiently solved by C-CG algorithm. Case studies indicate that the DRCD strategy has superiorities in improving the resilience of CPPS compared with other conventional models.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Industry 4.0 applications require communication networks with deterministic and bounded latency. Ethernet, augmented with the IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards, can meet these requirements. One of the TSN standards, Time Aware Shaper (TAS) is ideal for periodic time-sensitive traffic in wired TSN networks. However, it relies on network-wide synchronization to a common reference time. Existing solutions for developing TAS schedules assume perfect synchronization or consider a worst-case error. This study highlights the need for using network-derived time synchronization parameters and errors to optimize TAS schedules. It raises the importance of accurate time synchronization information and proposes a novel methodology for efficient band-width utilization while ensuring deadline requirements are met for time-sensitive traffic in realistic networks. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by simulating a TSN network in OMNeT++ and comparing the devised TAS schedules with schedules which use existing assumptions. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Deterministic transmission guarantee in time-sensitive networks (TSN) relies on queue models (such as CQF, TAS, ATS) and resource scheduling algorithms. Thanks to its ease of use, the CQF queue model has been widely adopted. However, the existing resource scheduling algorithms of CQF model only focus on periodic time-triggered (TT) flows without consideration of bursting flows. Considering that the bursting flows often carry high-priority data in real systems, in this paper we investigate the mixed-flow (i.e., TT and bursting flows) scheduling problem in CQF-based TSN aiming to maximize the number of schedulable flows and system load balance while satisfying the deterministic demands of delay, jitter, and reliability for both TT and bursting flows. Unfortunately, it is challenging to schedule the mixed flows with the original CQF model because of the huge difference between TT and bursting flows. To resolve this problem, we firstly design an enhanced Multi-CQF model to satisfy the basic demands of bursting flows sent at any time without affecting the deterministic transmission of TT flows. Given the complexity of mixed-flow scheduling and the proposed queue model, it is difficult for traditional algorithms to fully utilize network resources. Thus, we further propose a uline time-correlated uline DRL uline resource uline scheduling (TimeDRS) algorithm to optimize the resource allocation. TimeDRS can be extended to other time-related resource scheduling scenarios, such as TDMA-based scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approaches can greatly reduce frame loss and end-to-end latency for bursting flows, and well balance runtime and schedulability compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The IEEE 802.1Qbv standard schedules time-triggered (TT) flows (i.e., period flows) in a fixed TT Window each period. However,period flows generated by non-deterministic end systems exhibit significant jitter, whichleads to a mismatch between the generation times and the scheduled TT Windows. In the worst case scenario, this mismatch can cause an additional send delay of approximately one period in the flow. In this study,we model the send delay issue due to the maximum send delay requirement for all frames in a period flow not being satisfied simultaneously, and measure the jitter of period flows in a typical non-deterministic end system. Moreover, we propose an access mechanism for jittered period flows to schedule multiple conflict-free TT Windows in each period of flows at the source end system and control the send delay within the required delay tolerance. This mechanism enables deterministic access to jittered period flows, providing a prerequisite for reliable end-to-end transmission in the network. Moreover, this mechanism adopts a multi-objective integer linear programming (MILP) solver to optimize the TT Windows schedule. Furthermore, we establish the constraints and objective functions for the MILP solver and evaluate the mechanism with actual sampled frames in a real non-deterministic end system. Compared with the conventional fixed single TT Window and worst-case delay analysis mechanisms, the proposed mechanism satisfies the send delay requirements and considerably reduces the buffer usage at the source end system. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) set of standards allows to support on the same channel the different kinds of traffic flows that are typically found in automotive scenarios. This article proposes the introduction of online Earliest Deadline First-based scheduling in TSN to provide support for event-driven real-time traffic. The proposed approach, called Deadline-TSN, is an online approach, and therefore, unlike other approaches in the literature, it does not require complex offline schedule calculations. Moreover, Deadline-TSN is able to uniformly deal with real-time periodic and event-driven traffic flows. This article presents Deadline-TSN and provides both worst-case response time analysis and simulative assessments in realistic automotive scenarios.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Many time-sensitive networked systems, such as networked control systems or other cyber/physical systems, require well-defined Quality of Service (QoS) with guaranteed deterministic bounds on network delay. Existing QoS models typically provide no guarantees for excess traffic beyond the traffic specified during the initial admission process. This can lead to a waste of resources when applications overcompensate during resource reservation to avoid traffic violations. In this work, we propose the Dynamic Priority Token Bucket (DPTB), a fundamentally different new QoS model. DPTB permits short-time violations without immediately dropping to best-effort guarantees for excess traffic. Instead, the priority of the application gets degraded to weaker but still deterministic guarantees. At any point in time, the application can calculate the currently guaranteed delay bounds, which depend only on its own past sending behavior, to enable application-level adaptation of the sending rate and application-side prediction of the implications onto the application performance. We designed DPTB as a token bucket extension that can be used on top of several existing scheduling mechanisms, such as the Asynchronous Traffic Shaper of IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). Our evaluations show that DPTB is more resilient to bursty cross-traffic, resulting in significantly lower average delays than regular reservations.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - A deterministic real-time communication is required by the effective management of physical processes in Cyber Physical Systems including industrial automation, in-vehicle and avionic communication platforms. IEEE 802.1 Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group is the leading organization that aims to standardize Ethernet-based deterministic communication technologies. In this paper, a Multi-Topology Routing (MTR)-based traffic optimization approach is developed for the route planning of AVB streams in a TSN network with mixed-criticality support using the GRASP meta-heuristic. MTR was standardized by IETF as extensions to OSPF and IS-IS, and supports virtual topologies which have the same network graph as the physical topology, but with different link weights. Thanks to the diverse forwarding capabilities provided by the MTR concept, experimental results show that our approach significantly improves the schedulability of AVB streams in the majority of the scenarios compared to the other approaches in the literature. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Edge enabled Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform is of great significance to accelerate the development of smart industry. However, with the dramatic increase in real-time IIoT applications, it is a great challenge to support fast response time, low latency, and efficient bandwidth utilization. To address this issue, time sensitive network (TSN) is recently researched to realize low latency communication via deterministic scheduling. To the best of our knowledge, the combinability of multiple flows, which can significantly affect the scheduling performance, has never been systematically analyzed before. In this article, we first analyze the combinability problem. Then, a noncollision theory based deterministic scheduling (NDS) method is proposed to achieve ultralow latency communication for the time-sensitive flows. Moreover, to improve bandwidth utilization, a dynamic queue scheduling (DQS) method is presented for the best-effort flows. Experiment results demonstrate that NDS/DQS can well support deterministic ultralow latency services and guarantee efficient bandwidth utilization.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The network architecture with the controller area network (CAN) as the domain bus in most domains and time-sensitive networking (TSN) as the backbone network is called the CAN-TSN interconnection network architecture, which has been or will be employed in industrial embedded networks (e.g., automobiles, spacecraft, and factory automation). In this architecture, the CAN-TSN gateway acts as a transmission hub handling a large number of communications between the CAN domains and TSN. However, most commercial CAN-TSN gateways are highly integrated with low flexibility, such that they are hard to accommodate different time planning mechanisms from TSN. In addition, these CAN-TSN gateways suffer from high congestion when TSN frames are sent from the TSN side to a CAN domain (i.e., TSN-to-CAN transmission) because of at least 100 times in the transmission rate between CAN and TSN. In this study, we propose a high-flexibility CAN-TSN gateway, where the CAN side can be easily adapted to different bus protocols, and the TSN side can be easily adapted to different configurations. In the gateway, we develop a low-congestion TSN-to-CAN scheduler, which executes a maximum awaiting time (MAT)-based scheduling strategy to alleviate the congestion. Experiments on the prototype platform show the advantages of the proposed CAN-TSN gateway and the developed MAT-based scheduling strategy.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.

AB  - With the increasing adoption of industrial Ethernet in train communication network (TCN), the limitations of insufficient reliability and incompatibility between different Ethernet technologies have become increasingly apparent. To address these challenges, time-sensitive networking (TSN) has emerged as a solution, enabling multi-network convergence and enhancing data transmission determinism and reliability through techniques such as frame replication and elimination for reliability (FRER). However, the utilization of these policies will adversely affect schedulability due to increased network load. To address the issue of link failures in TCN topologies, a routing policy based on faulty link diagnosis is proposed. The proposed policy utilizes an improved max-min ant system (IMMAS) for diagnosing and resolving faulty links. Furthermore, a routing optimization algorithm is introduced to enhance transmission reliability by planning alternative paths for traffic. To evaluate the performance of the proposed routing algorithm, multiple sets of test cases are conducted separately under different failure scenarios to compare them with other routing policies. The results demonstrate the superior reliability of the proposed routing policy over alternative approaches. Additionally, the traffic utilizing the proposed routing policy show improved schedulability following integer linear programming (ILP) scheduling. © 2024 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan and Wiley Periodicals LLC. © 2024 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan and Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN) aims at providing a solid underpinning for the support of application connectivity demands across a wide spectrum of use cases and operational environments, such as industrial automation and automotive networks. However, handling network updates in TSN entails additional challenges, stemming from the need to perform both flow rerouting and TSN schedule reconfiguration. To address this issue, we propose a software-defined network (SDN)-based approach for low-overhead TSN network updates, exploiting segment routing over IPv6 (SRv6) for path control. To this end, we introduce the concept of TSN subgraphs in order to quickly reschedule the flows traversing the problematic area and propose a TSN-aware routing heuristic to minimize the convergence time. We further describe the control plane implementation and its integration into Mininet, which empowers us to conduct a wide range of performance tests. Our evaluation results indicate that our approach yields faster recovery and reduces significantly the number of required reconfigurations upon failures, at the expense of a small SRv6 encoding/decoding overhead. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In order to provide consistent low-latency communication network services, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) unites a set of standards for time-synchronization, flow control, enhanced reliability, and management. We design the TSN-FlexTest testbed with generic commodity hardware and open-source software components to enable flexible TSN measurements. We have conducted extensive measurements to validate the TSN-FlexTest testbed and to examine TSN characteristics. The measurements provide insights into the effects of TSN configurations, such as increasing the number of synchronization messages for the Precision Time Protocol, indicating that a measurement precision of 30 ns can be achieved. The TSN measurements included extensive evaluations of the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) for sets of Tactile Internet (TI) packet traffic streams. The measurements elucidate the effects of different scheduling and shaping approaches, while revealing the need for pervasive network control that synchronizes the sending nodes with the network switches. We present the first measurements of distributed TAS with synchronized senders on a commodity hardware testbed, demonstrating the same Quality-of-Service as with dedicated wires for high-priority TI streams despite a 200% over-saturation cross traffic load. The testbed is provided as an open-source project to facilitate future TSN research.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - As Ethernet has a large bandwidth capacity, it is commonly proposed as a backbone for future intra-vehicle networks. However, satisfying the severe hardware reliability requirements of intra-vehicle networks while providing high-bandwidth and low latency by Ethernet may be costly. As a solution, we propose a novel optical intra-vehicle backbone network architecture that may have a lower cost and higher reliability in terms of hardware when compared to Ethernet. However, unlike traditional optical Ethernet architectures, only a single master node has transmitter laser diodes in the backbone of our architecture, so the gateway nodes cannot generate and send packets to the backbone links directly. As the gateways cannot inform the master node and request a slot when they have a new packet to send, a slot scheduling algorithm with polling is necessary to detect and transfer the new packets in the gateways, which may cause higher transmission delays compared to Ethernet. In this paper, we present our optical intra-vehicle backbone network architecture and propose two slot scheduling algorithms. We show that using a dynamic slot scheduling algorithm decreases packet delays when compared to fixed periodic slot scheduling in our architecture. We also evaluate the total delays including traffic shaping and processing delays in an optical TSN Ethernet backbone architecture as a reference. We show that the extra delays due to slot scheduling in our architecture may be negligibly low when compared with traffic shaping and processing delays. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, we present a three-layer (i.e., device, field, and factory layers) deterministic federated learning (FL) framework, named DetFed, which accelerates collaborative learning process for ultra-reliable and low-latency industrial Internet of Things (IoT) via integrating 6G-oriented Time-sensitive Networks (TSN). Utilizing dispersive local data, industrial IoT devices distributively train a deep neural network (DNN) model, and the updated model parameters are aggregated at their associated field servers every round or at a centralized factory server every a few rounds. Aiming at optimizing the learning accuracy of FL without affecting the co-transmission of burst traffic (e.g., safety-critical traffic), an integrated TSN is considered to establish connections among the three layers, where a cyclic queuing and forwarding mechanism is deployed in each switch to support deterministic model parameter transmission with microsecond-level delay and near-zero packet loss requirements. To improve the FL performance, we formulate a multi-objective stochastic optimization problem to simultaneously maximize the scheduling success ratio and learning accuracy while satisfying the deterministic requirements of delay, jitter, and packet loss. Since the objective function is implicit and the available time slots of the considered TSN in each FL round are temporally correlated, the problem is difficult to solve in real time. Therefore, we transform the problem into a Markov decision process formulation and propose a dynamic resource scheduling algorithm, based on deep reinforcement learning, to make optimal resource scheduling decisions while adapting to device heterogeneity and network dynamics. Experimental results based on real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed DetFed significantly accelerates FL convergence and improves learning accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - With the advancement of Industry 4.0, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has become essential for ensuring prompt and reliable data transmission. As an augmentation of Ethernet, TSN aims to supply services capable of low latency, minimal jitter, and low packet loss for urgent data in decentralized, user-oriented networks. Efficient detection techniques are integral to TSN for swiftly determining the practicability of network configurations, as existing schedulability analysis proves insufficient. This paper delves into the potential of backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) in schedulability analysis efficiency. We optimize BPNN using spearman correlation feature selection combined with a voting ensemble method and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), forming two models: Spearman-Vote-BPNN and Spearman-PSO-BPNN. Testing on 5,000 network configurations in computer simulations, both models demonstrated high generalization accuracy, around 97.4%. Spearman-Vote-BPNN achieved the fastest training speed at 0.63 s and an accuracy of 98.2%. Meanwhile, Spearman-PSO-BPNN showed the highest accuracy (98.5%) with the quickest detection speed (5.6 ms). The outcomes of this research significantly advance the efficacy and precision of TSN network configuration detection and establish a formidable groundwork for future scholarly pursuits in this area. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Ongoing changes in industrial automation aim to-wards a flat and highly interconnected architecture that includes end-to-end real-time enabled machine-to-machine communications. Several technologies, such as OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) publish-subscribe and time-sensitive networking (TSN), facilitate that change. While OPC UA PubSub and TSN can already provide real-time capabilities, the parallel operation with standard OPC UA client-server remains an open challenge. This article presents preliminary results for solving concurrent information model access between OPC UA PubSub and client-server. The results include the overall RT-TSN-OPC UA concept, an analysis of common concurrent data access mechanisms for their suitability, and identifying critical code segments in the open62541 OPC UA stack. The paper concludes by outlining further research focusing on implementing and evaluating a wait-and obstruction-free mechanism into open62541.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Safety-critical traffic in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires real-time communications with high fault tolerance, bounded latency and low jitter. Time-Sensitive Software-Defined Network (TSSDN), which combines the deterministic transmission of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) with the centralized management of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), was recently proposed to support the real-time requirement in IIoT. The research on TSSDN has been receiving increasing interests, however, the existing work has limitations including 1) the functional safety of TSSDN cannot be guaranteed; and 2) the effect of the separation of data plane and control plane on the time-sensitivity of TSSDN has not been evaluated. Therefore, in this paper, we employ the timed model checker UPPAAL to formalize the TSSDN architecture. Firstly, we use the build-in checker in UPPAAL to verify deadlock-free property, functional safety property and starvation-free property of our model. Then, the total latency of frames forwarding and scheduling within a single switch is measured based on the model. We focus on the latency overhead of frames requesting processing rules from the controller, which is on average an additioanl 180µs latency in the worst case, but the impact of this delay on the time-sensitivity of TSSDN is tolerable. As far as we know, this is the first paper providing a formal verification and analysis approach for TSSDN architecture, which could benefit for both TSSDN designers as well as the researchers. © 2022 Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.

AB  - In-vehicle networks are increasingly using complex functions to enhance user convenience. This has led to a rise in both the number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and the bandwidth between data traffic. Ethernet communication has been adopted to address this issue in a network where multimedia and control traffic coexists. However, a solution was still required to maintain Quality-of-Service (QoS), which led to the emergence of the Time-Sensitive Network (TSN). In this situation, TSN, which defines rules for real-time, reliability, etc., is gaining attention. In this paper, we compare the performance of Time Aware Shaper (TAS) and frame preemption methods for real-time scheduling among TSN protocols. Furthermore, we propose a method to enhance QoS by predicting overhead and flexibly selecting preemption size. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is increasingly relying on the low-latency and low-jitter information exchange. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) guarantees the deterministic transmission by a set of mechanisms, such as Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) and Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF). However, the deterministic scheduling of hybrid traffic with different Quality of Service (QoS) is still unresolved since traffic performance is hard to meet by a single mechanism or an integrated mechanism with fixed time slot. In this paper, to realize the low-latency and low-jitter hybrid traffic scheduling, an adaptive time slot slicing (ATSS) method is proposed integrating TAS and CQF. With dynamically slicing the time slot to centralize time-triggered (TT) traffic, ATSS eliminates the irregular distribution of TT flow to support multi-hop networks. A resource calculation method based on slot occupancy judgment is devised to reduce the scheduling complexity, which raises the analysis objects into flows instead of frames. To reduce the complexity further, an incremental algorithm with the search boundary of resources is designed. The evaluation results show that ATSS reduces the jitter by 12 times and time cost by 200 times when handling over 125 mixed flows in different network topologies compared to previous work.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - At present, Time-Sensitive Networking has attracted extensive attention in automatic driving, Industrial 4.0, 5G and so on. TSN is used to guarantee the real-time transmission of critical traffic with bounded delay, which is realized by a variety of traffic scheduling mechanisms. One important mechanism of research is Time Aware Shaper mechanism, but current researches on this mechanism usually have the following problems: (a) It takes a long time to get the solution of the algorithm; (b) It's difficult to schedule burst traffic and the algorithm depends on time synchronization; (c) There is a waste of bandwidth. The core idea of TAS mechanism is time division multiplexing, and the solution of transmission time is the key of traffic scheduling. This paper proposes an adaptive scheduling algorithm based on TAS to avoid above problems. First, the worst-case scheduling problem of actual traffic is seen as the scheduling problem of continuous traffic, and the transmission time of continuous traffic of the worst-case delay is analyzed; Second, the concept of queue scheduling is proposed to optimize scheduling, which achieves the adaptive scheduling of actual traffic, does not depend on time synchronization, and improve bandwidth utilization; Finally, the worst-case delay of the algorithm in actual traffic scheduling is analyzed. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Distributed Control Systems (DCSs) for emerging industrial control applications impose new communication requirements that cannot be satisfied by current Industrial Ethernet protocols. As a result, industry is pushing the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards as the de-facto Ethernet-based linklayer to fulfill these requirements. Adequate roadmaps are needed to support a smooth transition from Industrial-Ethernet-based legacy systems to TSN-based ones. In this context some works propose mechanisms to migrate, i.e. map, route and schedule, legacy traffic to TSN. However none of them considers traffic including streams with spatial redundancy requirements and, thus, they cannot be used to migrate legacy highly-reliable DCSs. The present work extends a previous toolchain to migrate, for the first time, legacy critical traffic that includes spatially redundant streams. Particularly, since redundancy is costly, this work proposes and compares two routing methods that consider one redundant stream per traffic.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Over the last two decades, IEEE has been defining standards for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). These standards combine traffic shaping and scheduling mechanisms to guarantee bounded delays across an Ethernet network. Time-Sensitive Networks are designed for applications where delays are critical, such as process control, networks for vehicles and aircraft, and virtual reality applications. Many industrial companies are currently actively implementing TSN standards. The goal of this paper is to provide a concise and self-contained description of the TSN mechanisms and how they affect the network performance metrics. The paper is intended for practicing engineers wanting to improve their understanding of TSN and for students curious about these mechanisms. © 1998-2012 IEEE.

AB  - With the increasing popularity of time-sensitive network applications and the gradual integration of the Tactile Internet into people’s lives, how to ensure ultra-low latency has become a demand and challenge for network performance. Therefore, it is extremely important to analyze the performance of the Tactile Internet. In this paper, we propose an analytical model based on deterministic network calculus (DNC) to quantitatively derive the end-to-end performance bounds of the Tactile Internet, develop a tandem model describing the communication of the Tactile Internet network, and analyze delay-related traffic parameters, such as arrival rate and burst size. We investigate the variation of the accuracy of the DNC analytical model and the measurement model under different parameters, and verify the accuracy of the proposed DNC analytical model by theoretical derivation and analysis and comparison with the measurement model under the NS3 platform. We discuss the impact of relevant parameters on the delay boundaries to determine which network configuration enables the end-to-end delay to meet the established requirements. This will provide valuable guidance for the design of Tactile Internet architectures. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Standard Ethernet networks cannot provide solutions to handle latency sensitive applications efficiently. The packet scheduling algorithms like First In First Out (FIFO), Class Based Queueing (CBQ), and others do not provide efficient solutions to Quality of Service (QoS) parameters like end-toend delay, packet loss, and jitter. Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) can be used as a solution to provide QoS to time sensitive applications. TSN has emerged as a future of realtime communication. The main advantage of TSN is that it enables determinism by supporting time critical traffic while the best effort traffic is also present in the network. This paper explores two of the most popular and widespread traffic shaping mechanisms in TSN: Time Aware Shaper (TAS) and Credit Based Shaper (CBS). IEEE 802.1Qbv is used for delivering time assurance using TAS. CBS is a key traffic shaping algorithm to provide bandwidth assurance to the time critical and real time traffic, such as the audio traffic. This paper evaluates TAS and CBS using TSN enabled Network Interface Cards (NIC) with time synchronization, real time kernel and real traffic, which includes time sensitive traffic and elastic background traffic. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Time-sensitive networks (IEEE TSN or IETF DetNet) may tolerate some packet reordering. Re-sequencing buffers are then used to provide in-order delivery, the parameters of which (timeout, buffer size) may affect worst-case delay and delay jitter. There is so far no precise understanding of per-flow reordering metrics nor of the dimensioning of re-sequencing buffers in order to provide worst-case guarantees, as required in such networks. First, we show that a previously proposed per-flow metric, reordering late time offset (RTO), determines the timeout value. If the network is lossless, another previously defined metric, the reordering byte offset (RBO), determines the required buffer. If packet losses cannot be ignored, the required buffer may be larger than RBO, and depends on jitter, an arrival curve of the flow at its source, and the timeout. Then we develop a calculus to compute the RTO for a flow path; the method uses a novel relation with jitter and arrival curve, together with a decomposition of the path into non order-preserving and order-preserving elements. We also analyse the effect of re-sequencing buffers on worst-case delay, jitter and propagation of arrival curves. We show in particular that, in a lossless (but non order-preserving) network, re-sequencing is 'for free', namely, it does not increase worst-case delay nor jitter, whereas in a lossy network, re-sequencing increases the worst-case delay and jitter. We apply the analysis to evaluate the performance impact of placing re-sequencing buffers at intermediate points and illustrate the results on two industrial test cases.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.

AB  - With real-time communication being a key part of the fourth industrial revolution, the need for Quality of Service (QoS) in industrial networks is gaining increasing importance. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) faces this need, for example, by introducing new scheduling mechanisms. The Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) has been introduced to TSN to offer low delays for multiple traffic classes by applying rate limitations. Currently, flows are reserved decentrally in CBS networks using a Stream Reservation Protocol (SRP). In contrast, the new TSN standard IEEE 802.1Qcc allows for a centralized architecture to favor short reconfiguration latencies. However, no online admission control scheme which offers safe delay bounds has been proposed for this central architecture. To close this gap, we propose two models for admission control in TSN networks using CBS. Both models offer deadline-guaranteeing flow allocation, including routing and prioritization of flows, and configure forwarding devices while eliminating packet loss. Our models utilize the mathematical framework of Network Calculus to calculate worst-case flow delays and buffer sizes. We show how our models allow for more reservations than the decentralized standard approach by improved resource utilization. We validate our models both in synthetic and industrial network scenarios. Additionally, we compare the effects and parameters of our two models, providing guidance on when to choose them.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Today, industrial real-time communication is commonly designed based on two key principles to satisfy the challenging Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of industrial applications: a) local communication and b) purpose-built networks. IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and IETF Deterministic Networking (DetNet) promise to lift these two limitations. This facilitates the transformation of previously loosely integrated automation network parts from isolated, purpose-built real-time networks to more tightly integrated, open, multi-purpose networks of networks. With TSN and DetNet, each of these interconnected networks, e.g., machine or backbone networks, can and will be fined-tuned for optimal performance regarding the different real-time applications located inside them. The resulting patchwork of DetNet-connected TSN networks, however, creates a challenge for cross-network real-time communication: predicting QoS properties, such as the end-to-end latency. To address this challenge, we propose a model that allows calculating best-case and worst-case latencies for time-critical communication across different DetNet-connected TSN networks. This enables validating end-to-end communication requirements in open, multi-purpose industrial networks. Our evaluation with real industrial hardware shows the applicability of our proposed model.  © 2022 ACM.

AB  - Controller Area Network (CAN) and Ethernet network are expected to co-exist in automotive industry as Ethernet provides a high-bandwidth communication, while CAN is a legacy cost-effective solution. Due to the shortcomings of conventional switched Etherent, such as determinism, IEEE Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group developed a set of standards to enhance the switched Ethernet technology providing low-jitter and deterministic communication. Considering these two network domains, we investigate various design approaches for a gateway that connects a CAN domain to a TSN domain. We present three gateway forwarding techniques and we develop end-to-end delay analysis methods for them. Via the analysis methods and applying them to synthetic use cases we show that the intuitive existing approach of encapsulating multiple CAN frames into a single Ethernet frame is not necessarily an efficient solution. In fact, we demonstrate several cases where it is preferable to encapsulate only one CAN frame into a TSN frame, in particular when we use a high speed TSN network. The results have a significant impact on developing such gateways as the implementation of the one-to-one frame encapsulation is considerably simpler than other complex gateway-forwarding techniques. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - As an emerging communication technology, time-sensitive networking (TSN) promises the real time and deterministic interaction of massive data in Industrial Internet of Things. However, it is challenging to schedule the time-sensitive flows timely and superiorly through the mechanism analysis for current TSN scheduling models, especially in complex industrial scenarios. In this article, we propose an analysis approach of flow sequences based on divisibility theory to characterize the flow conflicts and dependencies, which derives the scheduling flexibility based on flow position diversity (PD) and the equivalent flow judgment conditions for slot occupancy. Integrating the abovementioned derivation, a parallel computing framework with the generalized slot length is established to lower the scheduling complexity. Within each computing unit, an incremental scheduling algorithm with the flow judgment conditions and PD-based search boundary is proposed. It reduces the scheduling complexity further while maintaining load balance for the mixed transmission of periodic and aperiodic flows. To achieve the optimality of runtime and load balance, two PD-based flow sorting strategies are designed, respectively. The evaluation results show that compared with the existing works, the runtime efficiency of scheduling at scale is increased by at least 1500 times in complex traffic scenarios while the load balance on the network links is also improved.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - With the advent of Industry 4.0 and the popularization of smart terminal equipment, the interaction between industrial field information systems and production equipment has intensified. To meet the real-time transmission of time-triggered flow and the coordinated transmission of best effort flow, time-sensitive network-related technologies are used to implement flow queue forwarding by strictly following the gate control list. First, response-time analysis method is proposed to predict the upper bound of delay under a scheduling model following IEEE 802.1Qbv. Second, according to response-time analysis, a deadline monotonic scheduling algorithm with temporary priority expansion is proposed to divide the priority into more levels, which is not limited by the queue type, so as to ameliorate the transmission sequence of switch export flow. Finally, an adaptive priority adjustment scheduling algorithm with temporary priority expansion is designed to construct the optimal scheduling method further improving the scheduling success rate and reducing worst-case end-to-end delays. Compared with similar algorithms, the algorithm proposed improves the scheduling success rate by at least 30%, reduces the total delay by at least 21% and the TT flow delay by 11% in high network utilization conditions.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Ultra-low latency (ULL) is a challenging but nonetheless essential network requirement to achieve in many contexts. Industrial automation (IEC/IEEE 60802), in-vehicle communications (IEEE P802.1DG), audio and video bridging (IEEE Std 802.1BA), aerospace, and 5G fronthaul (IEEE 802.1CM) applications demand a low network latency in the order of few milliseconds or even microseconds. ULL services target a more controlled latency for end-to-end device communication and, in critical environments, near real-time connections. Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN) aim at providing deterministic connectivity over IEEE 802 networks guaranteeing packet transport with bounded latency, low packet delay variation, and low packet loss. This work analyzes TSN latency mechanisms and examines how they influence E2E latency. Moreover, it builds a regression-based surrogate model that enables the creation of optimization models to find optimal configurations for a given TSN network. Our findings span the discussion of the characteristics of each individual TSN latency mechanism to the benefits achieved by the proposed optimization models and using these to achieve optimal E2E latency. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The existing worst-case response time (WCRT) analysis for individual priority classes under credit-based shaping (CBS) in Ethernet AVB based on so-called eligible intervals is both independent and tight. This WCRT analysis does not rely on any assumptions on interfering inter-priority streams other than those enforced by the Ethernet standard. A major advantage of this independent analysis is that CBS may be viewed as resource reservation, where allocated bandwidth is both guaranteed and enforced. Although independent analysis provides inter-priority class robustness, it comes at a cost of over-provisioning bandwidth. We illustrate this cost of inter-priority class robustness by means of an example that requires 7.8 times the amount of bandwidth reservation for a given set of streams compared to a different analysis that takes knowledge of inter-priority streams into account.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a promising solution for the next generation in-vehicle networks. To enable innovations in adaptability, there is a strong trend to integrate TSN with Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Software-defined TSN requires fast routing algorithms that guarantee the Worst-Case End-to-End Delay (WCED) of the Audio Video Bridging (AVB) flows. However, current AVB flow routing algorithms execute WCED analysis for an exponential amount of route candidates, which is not feasible at run-time. Current WCED analysis of the AVB flows depends on the specific flow setup of other traffic classes. When high-priority flows change, low-priority flows must be adjusted as well to maintain deadline guarantees. In this paper, we propose a per-class flow management scheme to enable run-time routing of the AVB flows. Our composable analysis computes a formal WCED bound of the AVB flows. It does not rely on the flow setup of other traffic classes. So, the WCED and routes can be computed for each traffic class independently and in parallel. Based on the analysis, we develop a fast heuristic algorithm to incrementally route the AVB flows with guaranteed deadlines. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to the existing solutions, the composable analysis is 2.6x faster. The cost is that the WCED bound can be up to 31% higher. When given a similar run-time as existing solutions, the proposed routing algorithm can set up 1.6x more flows. The average time to set up one flow is within 0.14s. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The smart factory is driving the deep integration of a new generation of information technology and manufacturing. Industrial digital twins, which monitor and manage all factors in the industrial process based on virtual representations, greatly improve the production quality control of manufacturing. Its popularization demands strong supports of the industrial field network and coordination of control and communication. This chapter proposes a new scheme of control and communication coordination for industrial digital twins, which takes the advantages of the following key technologies: (1) a new multi-tier coordination architecture toward the field of smart factory, which meets diverse requirements of the manufacturing process in industrial fields and facilitates the integration of communication technology (CT), operation technology (OT), and information technology (IT); (2) a time-sensitive networking (TSN) based deterministic and real-time communication for vast amount of data interaction in control and communication coordination for digital twins; (3) an intelligent modeling way for industrial process by integrating the numerical and data-driven methods; and (4) a digital twin-assisted intelligent decision-making mechanism. The scheme is verified by the case study on sintering process, where we construct more than 100 digital twins and achieve the production quality prediction accuracy of over 90% with 2-hour in advance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - To analyze the upper bound of end-to-end delay in time-sensitive networks, an improved calculation model of end-to-end transmission delay based on network calculus is derived according to the relevant knowledge of deterministic network calculus. The effects of GCL gate opening time, scheduling period, the overlap of transmission Windows, and different priorities of traffic on the delay index were analyzed experimentally, and the end-to-end worst-case transmission delay of time triggered (TT) traffic in the whole process of traffic transmission was calculated. Finally, through comprehensive analysis of GCL and reasonable configuration of parameters, good transmission capacity of the communication network is ensured, which provides a theoretical basis for efficient deployment of the communication network and optimal allocation of network resources.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - To reduce the latency of time-sensitive flows in Ethernet networks, the IEEE TSN Task Group introduced the IEEE 802.1Qbu Standard, which specifies a 1-level preemption scheme for IEEE 802.1 networks. Recently, serious limitations of this scheme w.r.t. flows responsiveness were exposed and the so-called multi-level preemption approach was proposed to address these drawbacks. As is the case with most, if not all, real-time and/or time-sensitive preemptive systems, an appropriate priority-to-flow assignment policy plays a central role in the resulting performance of both 1-level and multi-level preemption schemes to avoid the over-provisioning and/or the sub-optimal use of hardware resources. Yet on another front, the multi-level preemption scheme raises new configuration challenges. Specifically, the right number of preemption level(s) to enable for swift transmission of flows; and the flow-to-preemption-class assignment synthesis remain open problems. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work in the literature addressing these important challenges. In this work, we address these three challenges. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed solution by using both synthetic and real life use-cases. Our experimental results show that multi-level preemption schemes improve schedulability of flows by over 12% as compared to a 1-level preemption scheme, and at a higher abstraction level, the proposed configuration framework improves the schedulability of flows by up to 6% as compared to the dominant Deadline Monotonic Priority Ordering.  © 2022 ACM.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has emerged as a promising communication technology for automotive applications. The TSN standards provide a flexible toolkit, enabling network designers to select the features and mechanisms that best suit the application context requirements. TSN facilitates the management of diverse traffic flows through a single channel by defining transmission schemes and protocols. However, some automotive applications, such as the automated driving ones, require the support for event-driven real-Time traffic, but the TSN support for this kind of flows is limited. To overcome this limitation, a recent research proposed an online Earliest Deadline First-based scheduling approach, called Deadline-TSN, able to handle various traffic classes (including the event-driven ones) in a uniform way. Deadline-TSN supports real-Time traffic, but is not designed to support deterministic communications. For this reason, this paper investigates the adoption of TSN to build network setups for managing diverse kinds of in-car traffic flows, i.e., periodic and event-driven, with diverse timing constraints and presents a comparative performance evaluation between a configuration exploiting a combination of multiple TSN transmission schemes and Deadline-TSN in a realistic automotive scenario.  © 2023 AEIT.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a task group of the IEEE 802.1 standardization working group (WG) developing the IEEE 802.1 TSN communication standards. TSN is developing a 'toolbox' of many standards to provide support for enabling the separation of critical and non-critical traffic, the timeliness and dependability, i.e., reliability, fault-tolerance, and security, of critical traffic. In this paper we focus on the Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) traffic shapers, such as the original CQF, the Cycle Specified Queuing and Forwarding (CSQF) and an extension of those, the so-called Multi-CQF shaper. We define formally the problem of configuring CQF-based networks. We have developed a Constraint Programming (CP) formulation for Multi-CQF, as well as a Simulated Annealing (SA)-based metaheuristic solution. These solutions can also obtain results for CQF and CSQF, which can be seen as a special case of Multi-CQF. The CQF configuration problem is NP-hard. We evaluate our solutions on several test cases and scenarios. The CP formulation can find optimal solutions for small problem sizes but does not scale for realistic test cases. However, SA is able to handle large test cases and to find good quality solutions, making it suitable for both design-time and runtime network configuration. We also present comprehensive evaluation results comparing the CQF-based variants (CQF, CSQF, Multi-CQF) on industrial use cases, contrast them to the Time Aware Shaper (TAS, 802.1Qbv), and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In the automotive domain, Ethernet Audio Video Bridging (AVB) provides service guarantees for real-time traffic. Its configuration synthesis requires routing the flows and allocating the bandwidth for Credit Based Shaping (CBS). Current approaches typically employ deadline-oblivious bandwidth allocation and rely on routing to establish deadline guarantees. But the worst-case delay of AVB flows requires complex analysis. Thus, routing integrated with the delay analysis either supports limited Stream Reservation (SR) classes or suffers significant timing overhead. To enable efficient run-time flow setup, we propose SynAVB, a tool to synthesize the configuration of Ethernet AVB, which establishes deadline awareness in bandwidth allocation. SynAVB supports an arbitrary number of SR classes and processes them one by one. For the flows in an SR class, it first performs a deadline-oblivious routing based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to guarantee the necessary bandwidth required by the flows. Then, a deadline-aware slope allocation algorithm computes the bandwidth required on every link to satisfy the deadline of all flows. Our experiment demonstrates that, given the same routes, the deadline-aware bandwidth allocation results in fewer flows violating the deadline compared with other allocation strategies. Moreover, SynAVB can guarantee the deadline of more flows while its run-time is up to 14.3x faster than the state-of-the-art approaches.  © 2022 IEEE.

With the growing demand for high bandwidth, low latency, and reliability, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has been proposing a series of standards to improve the real-time performance of Ethernet, among which flow control strategies including Credit Based Shaping (CBS), Time-Aware Shaping (TAS), and Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) have been applied.Taking advantage of the globally synchronized clock, the TAS mechanism can achieve low latency for Time-Triggered (TT) traffic communication by establishing completely non-overlapping time windows, with the difficulties in higher system complexity. Using the token bucket shaping method, ATS can provide per-flow logical isolation for AVB traffic without the need for global clock synchronization. However, the improper parameter configuration of Committed Information Rate (CIR) and Committed Burst Rate (CBS) in ATS will lead to a dramatic rise in transmission latency.In this paper, to realize timing gate control under low complexity, a design of the flow control strategy, Gate Controlled Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (GCATS), which incorporates the Gate Control List (GCL) of TAS into the token bucket shaping method, is introduced. With the clock synchronization on the current node, GCATS reshapes traffic using an ATS-like per-flow token bucket method, reducing the computational cost and time constraints caused by the global clock synchronization of TAS. Simulation results show that, compared to TAS, GCATS configured with GCL tables of different granularity can provide fine-grained service for lower-priority traffic and reduce the transmission delay, that is, when given a default GCL, GCATS serves specific traffic without the need for network-wide clock synchronization. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we present an end-to-end timing model to capture timing information from software architectures of distributed embedded systems that use network communication based on the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards. Such a model is required as an input to perform end-to-end timing analysis of these systems. Furthermore, we present a methodology that aims at automated extraction of instances of the end-to-end timing model from component-based software architectures of the systems and the TSN network configurations. As a proof of concept, we implement the proposed end-to-end timing model and the extraction methodology in the Rubus Component Model (RCM) and its tool chain Rubus-ICE that are used in the vehicle industry. We demonstrate the usability of the proposed model and methodology by modeling a vehicular industrial use case and performing its timing analysis. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Static configurations in Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) using the Time-aware Shaper allow precise calculations of deterministic, tight bandwidth and latency guarantees for realtime industrial application streams. It is, however, this static configuration which makes introducing flexible changes to a running TSN system at runtime very hard. Scenarios of adaptive TSN networks envision that the network configuration evolves with time in accordance to anticipated changes such as the dynamicity of machine formations and machine reconfigurations. In this paper, we propose a notion of flexibility of scheduler configurations along a network path that facilitates introducing changes to TSN network configurations at runtime. Based on this notion, we develop and analyze algorithms to incrementally reconfigure TSN using the Time-Aware Shaper. These reconfigurations include determining the admissibility of new or changed streams that may possess individual deadlines.  © 2022 IFIP.

AB  - Existing papers on worst-case response time analysis for individual classes in Ethernet AVB typically focus on classes under credit-based shaping (CBS). There also exist industrial applications that use the Best-Effort class BE for non-hard real-time traffic with a minimum quality-of-service (QoS) require-ment, however. In this paper, we therefore present a conjecture for worst-case response time analysis for that class BE, stating that the existing analysis based on eligible intervals can be equally well applied to a single (highest-priority) stream without CBS, by simply assuming the remaining bandwidth to be available to that stream. The conjecture is illustrated using a figure.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Extraction of end-to-end timing information from software architectures of vehicular systems to support their timing analysis is a daunting challenge. To address this challenge, this paper presents a systematic method to extract this information from vehicular software architectures that can be distributed over several electronic control units connected by Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) networks. As a proof of concept, the proposed extraction method is applied to an industrial component model, namely the Rubus Component Model (RCM), and its toolchain. Furthermore, the usability of the proposed method is demonstrated in an industrial use case from the vehicular domain. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Current vehicles are changing, and control traffic and multimedia data are being used in a mixed method in a single network. In response to this, IEEE has announced a protocol called TSN, and there is active research underway to apply this standard to vehicles. However, previous studies have focused on the upper levels (between end systems (ES) and switches). To the best of our knowledge, there has been no research on scheduling methods between ES and the lower levels(Electronic Control Units (ECUs), actuators, and sensors). In this paper, the performance of the implemented ES on an embedded system and four methods for processing data received from lower layers were evaluated by analyzing the jitter of received frames. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Applications such as virtual/augmented reality, autonomous systems, and telemedicine require delay-bounded transmission. This paper combines the software-defined network (SDN) paradigm and proposes an integrated solution for topology construction and routing (TCR). First, the solution gives a delaybounded constraint for adding valid links, which can be adapted to various topology construction methods. Then, topology discovery, resource management, flow management, and route selection are performed in the orchestration and configuration plane. TCR enables time-sensitive network management and configuration with flexibility. The performance of the TCR is evaluated in a typical industrial network topology. The experimental results show that the TCR can effectively reduce the average path length (APL), guarantee bounded delay, and is beneficial for load balancing. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Time sensitive networking (TSN) is a new set of Ethernet standards that provide real-time and security for automotive, aerospace and industrial automation applications. Traffic in time sensitive networks has combination, complexity and flexibility. Due to the differences of devices in the actual network, time synchronization on time sensitive networks is sometimes difficult to achieve. Ensuring latency performance for critical traffic becomes a challenge. To solve this problem, we propose a non-synchronous time sensitive network traffic scheduling model and implement a Flexible window based GCL(FWND) scheduling. Experimental results show that the proposed scheduling method achieves traffic scheduling for non-synchronous TSN networks at the cost of a small worst end to end delay and average bandwidth usage.  © 2022 ACM.

AB  - Assessing traversal times is the main concern in the verification of embedded real-time networks. Schedulability analysis, as it provides firm guarantees, is the preferred technique for the designers of critical systems. There are however contexts where it is not economically or technically feasible to develop one, typically when the software and hardware components have not been designed with predictability in mind, e.g. as soon as TCP-based traffic is involved in network communication or when the hardware platform is too complex (e.g. heterogeneous System-on-Chips). In this paper, we study if it is possible to improve the ability of simulation to observe large traversal times, by running many short simulations with appropriately chosen simulation time and varying initial offsets of the stations on the network. The de-facto-standard approach to assess maximal traversal times is to run a single long simulation with synchronized node start offsets and to use randomized node clock drifts inside an acceptable range. This approach is known to yield high traversal times but is not parallelizable. We propose an alternative approach consisting in splitting the simulation time over multiple shorter simulations with, optionally, randomized node start offsets. We evaluate the optimization potential of this simple approach on several realistic network configurations by comparing long simulations to aggregated short simulations, with and without synchronized node start offsets. We observe, considering all flows, that this allows a median improvement of up to 21.3% in terms of maximum traversal time observed, for the same simulation time budget. Additional randomization of the node start offsets showed further improvements of up to 4.8% in our experiments. Results from this line of work can be used to estimate the pessimism of schedulability analyses and verify systems for which no analysis is available.  © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - To guarantee stringent real-time requirements of time-critical traffic in industrial systems, the IEEE time-sensitive networking (TSN) task group has standardized time-aware shaping (TAS) in IEEE 802.1Qbv, which schedules precise and periodic transmission times using preassigned traffic information. However, nonperiodic/unexpected but time-critical traffic, such as emergency events or alarms, may occur in real industrial scenarios, and TAS does not provision for performance of traffic that are unknown a priori, nor the impact thereof on prescheduled traffic. Moreover, recalculating the schedule for every sporadic, nonisochronous event traffic is extremely difficult, complex, and costly. To address these challenges, we propose a novel enhancement to TAS, referred to as eTAS, which defines a new scheduling rule for immediate forwarding of emergency traffic to guarantee real-time performance, while dynamically extending the scheduled time windows to protect scheduled time-critical traffic from the interference of emergency traffic. We evaluate eTAS through extensive simulations on OMNeT++ under an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) scenario for autonomous driving to show that eTAS effectively allows rapid transmission of event traffic with minimal impact on scheduled traffic, even for highly congested networks.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Computing accurate deterministic performance bounds is a strong need for communication technologies having stringent requirements on latency and reliability. Within new scheduling protocols such as TSN, the FIFO policy remains at work inside each class of communication. In this paper, we focus on computing deterministic performance bounds in FIFO networks in the Network Calculus framework. We propose a new algorithm based on linear programming that presents a trade-off between accuracy and tractability. This algorithm is first presented for tree networks. Next, we generalize our approach and present a linear program for computing performance bounds for arbitrary topologies, including cyclic dependencies. Finally, we provide numerical results, both of toy examples and realistic topologies, to assess the interest of our approach. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications have zero fault tolerance. Redundant networks are hence an important prerequisite for a dependable infrastructure to serve the various data traffic classes required for such applications. In this paper, we perform a delay analysis of a Quality Checks After Production (QCAP) application, which is running on a Time-Sensitive Network (TSN). We evaluate the worst-case delay of all data flows traversing the redundant TSN network using a Network Calculus (NC) based framework. We also evaluate how network parameters and configurations affect the QCAP application's service requirements. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - No specific implementation methods of traffic scheduling have been defined in the Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) protocols. Most research on traffic scheduling algorithms in TSN is for static network traffics. In this paper, a window based scheduling algorithm adaptive to network traffic fluctuations is proposed. An optimal period for Gate Control List (GCL) is firstly derived to guarantee the schedulability of control traffics. Then a dynamic window adjustment algorithm is proposed to maximize the bandwidth of best effort traffics. A simulated network is implemented based on OMNeT++/NeSTiNg simulation framework to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm significantly improves the delay and jitter performance under dynamic traffic configuration. The time-sensitive services can be guaranteed even when the traffic changes dynamically.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Model-Based Systems Engineering has often been associated with the Systems Modeling Language. Several SysML tools offer formal verification capabilities, and therefore enable early detection of design errors in the life cycle of systems. Model-checking is a common formal verification approach used to assess the satisfiability of properties. Thus, a SysML model and a property can be injected into a model-checker returning a true/false result. A drawback of this approach is that the entire SysML model is used for the verification, even if the property targets a sub-system of the model. In this paper, it is suggested to rely on dependency graphs to avoid applying model checking to the entire system when only a subset of the latter needs to be taken into account. We formalize SysML models and properties, then we present new algorithms to generate and reduce dependency graphs, so as to perform verification on reduced models. A case study on Time-Sensitive Networking is used to demonstrate the efficiency and limits of this approach. The algorithms described in the paper are fully implemented by the free software TTool. Our method enables an improvement in run time between 3% and 90% depending on the state space to be traversed to verify the property. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Time-sensitive networks require timely and accurate monitoring of the status of the network. To achieve this, many devices send packets periodically, which are then aggregated and forwarded to the controller. Bounding the aggregate burstiness of the traffic is then crucial for effective resource management. In this paper, we are interested in bounding this aggregate burstiness for independent and periodic flows. A deterministic bound is tight only when flows are perfectly synchronized, which is highly unlikely in practice and would be overly pessimistic. We compute the probability that the aggregate burstiness exceeds some value. When all flows have the same period and packet size, we obtain a closed-form bound using the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality. In the heterogeneous case, we group flows and combine the bounds obtained for each group using the convolution bound. Our bounds are numerically close to simulations and thus fairly tight. The resulting aggregate burstiness estimated for a non-zero violation probability is considerably smaller than the deterministic one: it grows in nlogn, instead of n, where n is the number of flows. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Integrating wired Ethernet networks, such as Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN), to 5G cellular network requires a flow management technique to efficiently map TSN traffic to 5G Quality-of-Service (QoS) flows. The 3GPP Release 16 provides a set of predefined QoS characteristics, such as priority level, packet delay budget, and maximum data burst volume, which can be used for the 5G QoS flows. Within this context, mapping TSN traffic flows to 5G QoS flows in an integrated TSN-5G network is of paramount importance as the mapping can significantly impact on the end-to-end QoS in the integrated network. In this paper, we present a novel and efficient mapping algorithm to map different TSN traffic flows to 5G QoS flows. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first QoS-aware mapping algorithm based on the application constraints used to exchange flows between TSN and 5G network domains. We evaluate the proposed mapping algorithm on synthetic scenarios with random sets of constraints on deadline, jitter, bandwidth, and packet loss rate. The evaluation results show that the proposed mapping algorithm can fulfill over 90% of the applications' constraints. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Recently, time-sensitive networking (TSN) has been developed to incorporate real-time capabilities to the standard Ethernet for the incompatible issue in existing industrial communication solutions and is considered a promising solution to satisfy the requirements of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, the routing and scheduling methods are left out of the TSN standard. This study developed a novel joint traffic routing and scheduling algorithm to compute routes for time-critical flows and construct the schedules. The validity of the proposed algorithm was verified using a random synthetic test scenario. The simulation results demonstrated that the real-time requirements of time-critical traffic could be satisfied with the proposed algorithm. Subsequently, we evaluated the scalability of the proposed algorithm from the perspective of the number of flows that can be scheduled and the network size. The results showed that the computational times for 4000 flows in the realistic industrial network topology and random network topologies (with up to 21 switches and 105 end stations) are at the subsecond level, which indicated the perfect scalability of the proposed algorithm. In addition, compared with the well-known integer linear programming (ILP)-based approach, Degree of Conflict (DoC)-aware iterative routing and scheduling (DA/IRS) approach, and hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA)-based approach, the proposed algorithm is faster than the three approaches by at least an order of magnitude.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - By bringing industrial-grade robustness and reliability to Ethernet, Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) offers an IEEE standard communication technology that enables interoperability between standard-conformant industrial devices from any vendor. It also eliminates the need for physical separation of critical and non-critical communication networks, which allows a direct exchange of data between operation centers and companies, a concept at the heart of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This article describes creating an end-to-end TSN network using specialized PCI Express (PCIe) cards and two final Linux endpoints. For this purpose, the two primary standards of TSN, IEEE 802.1AS (regarding clock synchronization), and IEEE 802.1Qbv (regarding time scheduled traffic) have been implemented in Linux equipment as well as a configuration and monitoring system. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an industry-standard networking protocol that is widely deployed in safety-critical industrial and automotive networks thanks to its quality-of-service (QoS) mechanisms, esp. deterministic transmission and bounded end-to-end delay for time-triggered (TT) flows. In this article, we focus on TT flows and address the issue of fault tolerance against permanent and transient faults with both spatial and temporal redundancy. We present an efficient heuristic algorithm for online incremental rerouting and rescheduling of disrupted flows, assuming the paths and schedules of existing flows stay fixed. It is complementary to and can be combined with offline routing and scheduling algorithms for achieving fault tolerance based on frame replication and elimination for reliability (FRER) (IEEE 802.1CB). Performance evaluation shows that our approach is able to better recover the system's degree of redundancy (DoR) and has a higher acceptance rate than related work. © 1982-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The automation of quality checks of a product in a smart manufacturing environment poses several challenges for the underlying industrial network. Such a network involves a variety of connected devices, e.g. sensors, actuators, embedded computers, to perform detection of a newly arriving product, visual inspection for quality checks, and classification to decide on the final quality of the product. These devices generate different types of data flows depending on their function. Here, we model the use case of quality checks using visual inspection after production. We consider the industrial network to be based on Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards to meet the different data flow quality of services (QoS) requirements. We use OMNET ++ to model our use case. In addition, we extend an existing TSN module implementation to configure the network layer for our application model. We conduct a set of simulations while considering worst case analysis with infinite and finite queue sizes, and realistic data traffic models. Our simulation results show that using a combination of Time Aware (TAS) and Credit-based (CBS) shaping outperforms standard and priority Ethernet queuing strategies and achieves a high delivery ratio of 100% for critical data traffic and 94% for burst traffic, while meeting end-to-end latency requirements.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards provide a toolbox of features to be utilized in various application domains.The core TSN features include deterministic zero-jitter and low-latency data transmission and transmitting traffic with various levels of time-criticality on the same network. To achieve a deterministic transmission, the TSN standards define a time-aware shaper that coordinates transmission of Time-Triggered (TT) traffic. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of scheduling the TT traffic and we propose a heuristic algorithm, called HERMES. Unlike the existing scheduling solutions, HERMES results in a significantly faster algorithm run-time and a high number of schedulable networks. HERMES can be configured in two modes of zero or relaxed reception jitter while using multiple TT queues to improve the schedulability. We compare HERMES with a constraint programming (CP)-based solution and we show that HERMES performs better than the CP-based solution if multiple TT queues are used, both with respect to algorithm run-time and schedulability of the networks.  © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - The growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices brings enormous time-sensitive applications, which require real-time transmission to effectuate communication services. The ultrareliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) scenario in the fifth generation (5G) has played a critical role in supporting services with delay-sensitive properties. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) has been widely considered as a promising paradigm for enabling the deterministic transmission guarantees for 5G. However, TSN is a hybrid traffic system with time-sensitive traffic and best effort traffic, which require effective routing and scheduling to provide a deterministic and bounded delay. While joint optimization of time-sensitive and non-time-sensitive traffic greatly increases the solution space and brings a significant challenge to obtain solutions. Therefore, this article proposes a graph convolutional network-based deep reinforcement learning (GCN-based DRL) solution for the joint optimization problem in practical communication scenarios. The GCN is integrated into deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to obtain the network's spatial dependence and elevate the generalization performance of the proposed method. Specifically, the GCN adopts the first-order Chebyshev polynomial to approximate the graph convolution kernel, which reduces the complexity of the algorithm and improves the feasibility for the joint optimization task. Furthermore, priority experience replay is employed to accelerate the convergence speed of the model training process. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed GCN-based DRL algorithm has good convergence and outperforms the benchmark methods in terms of the average end-to-end delay.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Information leakage can have dramatic consequences on systems security. Among harmful information leaks, the timing information leakage occurs whenever an attacker successfully deduces confidential internal information. In this work, we consider that the attacker has access (only) to the system execution time. We address the following timed opacity problem: given a timed system, a private location and a final location, synthesize the execution times from the initial location to the final location for which one cannot deduce whether the system went through the private location. We also consider the full timed opacity problem, asking whether the system is opaque for all execution times. We show that these problems are decidable for timed automata (TAs) but become undecidable when one adds parameters, yielding parametric timed automata (PTAs). We identify a subclass with some decidability results. We then devise an algorithm for synthesizing PTAs parameter valuations guaranteeing that the resulting TA is opaque. We finally show that our method can also apply to program analysis. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.

AB  - This work addresses the impact of best-effort traffic on network-dependent real-time functions in distributed control systems. Motivated by the increased Ethernet use in real-time dependent domains, such as the automation industry, a growth driven by Industry 4.0, interconnectivity desires, and data thirst. Ethernet allows different network-based functions to converge on one physical network infrastructure. In the automation domain, converged networks imply that functions with different criticality and real-time requirements coexist and share the same physical resources. The IEEE 60802 Time-Sensitive Networking profile for Industrial Automation targets the automation industry and addresses Ethernet network determinism on converged networks. However, the profile is still in the draft stage at the time of writing this paper. Meanwhile, Ethernet already provides attributes utilized by network equipment to prioritize time-critical communication. This paper shows that Ethernet Controller filtering with prioritized processing is a prominent solution for preserving real-time guarantees while supporting best-effort traffic. A solution capable of eliminating all best-effort traffic interference in the real-time application is exemplified and evaluated on a VxWorks system. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Modern Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) combine critical real-time and non-critical best-effort tasks and messages onto an integrated multi-core multi-SoC hardware platform. The real-time safety-critical software tasks have complex interdependencies in the form of end-to-end latency chains featuring, e.g., sensing, processing/sensor fusion, and actuating. The underlying real-time operating systems running on top of the multi-core platform use static cyclic scheduling for the software tasks, while the communication backbone is either realized through PCIe or Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). In this paper, we address the problem of configuring ADAS platforms for automotive applications, which means deciding the mapping of tasks to processing cores and the scheduling of tasks and messages. Time-critical messages are transmitted in a scheduled manner via the timed-gate mechanism described in IEEE 802.1Qbv according to the pre-computed Gate Control List (GCL) schedule. We study the computation of the assignment of tasks to the available platform CPUs/cores, the static schedule tables for the real-time tasks, as well as the GCLs, such that task and message deadlines, as well as end-to-end task chain latencies, are satisfied. This is an intractable combinatorial optimization problem. As the ADAS platforms and applications become increasingly complex, such problems cannot be optimally solved and require problem-specific heuristics or metaheuristics to determine good quality feasible solutions in a reasonable time. We propose two metaheuristic solutions, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and one based on Simulated Annealing (SA), both creating static schedule tables for tasks by simulating Earliest Deadline First (EDF) dispatching with different task deadlines and offsets. Furthermore, we use a List Scheduling-based heuristic to create the GCLs in platforms featuring a TSN backbone. We evaluate the proposed solution with real-world and synthetic test cases scaled to fit the future requirements of ADAS systems. The results show that our heuristic strategy can find correct solutions that meet the complex timing and dependency constraints at a higher rate than the related work approaches, i.e., the jitter constraints are satisfied in over 6 times more cases, and the task chain constraints are satisfied in 41% more cases on average. Our method scales well with the growing trend of ADAS platforms. Copyright © 2022 McLean, Juul Hansen, Pop and Craciunas.

AB  - The traffic scheduling problems of in-vehicle electronic and electrical architectures are closely related to the reliability and real-time performance of in-vehicle communication. In order to solve the application problem of time-sensitive network (TSN) communication in the actual vehicle scene, a method of establishing the vehicle time sensitive network model is proposed. A traffic scheduling strategy based on the time shaping mechanism (TAS) is designed for the transmission of multiple types of information flows in the network architecture, and a low-latency and highly reliable traffic scheduling scheme is obtained by using a genetic algorithm. Finally, the feasibility of the scheduling strategy is demonstrated through simulation experiments.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Length Rate Quotient (LRQ) is the first algorithm of interleaved shaping – a novel concept proposed to provide per-flow shaping for a flow aggregate without per-flow queuing. This concept has been adopted by Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Deterministic Networking (DetNet). In this paper, we investigate basic properties of LRQ interleaved shapers. One is the so-called “shaping-for-free” property, which is, when an LRQ interleaved shaper is appended to a FIFO system, it does not increase the worst-case delay of the system. The other basic properties include conformance, output characterization, a sufficient and necessary condition for bounded delay, Guaranteed Rate characterization, and delay and backlog bounds for LRQ interleaved shapers as stand-alone elements. The derived properties of LRQ shed new insights on understanding interleaved shaping, which may be further exploited to achieve bounded delay in TSN/DetNet networks. © 2023, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

AB  - Latency and jitter are two main requirements when controlling cyber-physical systems, especially in case of remote control through a network. When jitter is a major concern, one can either control the jitter all along the path, or compensate it by buffering at reception. This is usually done by the destination host, but it can also be done by the last network node. We call this approach Egress TT. This paper presents Egress TT, its benefits in terms of configuration time and applicative constraints. It also presents two possible implementations within a Time Sensitive Networking context.  © 2022 ACM.

AB  - The Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) amendments and protocols add capabilities on top of standard 802.1 Ethernet for guaranteeing the timeliness of both (isochronous) scheduled traffic (ST) and shaped (audio-video) communication (AVB) in distributed applications. ST streams are guaranteed via an offline computed schedule controlling the time-aware gate mechanism of IEEE 802.1Qbv, while AVB real-time streams are shaped via a credit-based shaper (CBS) and scheduler with lower-priority than ST. Although the two traffic classes use different TSN mechanisms, they are interrelated as the ST traffic class schedule influences the latency of AVB traffic. In this paper, we propose a method for the integration of the ST schedule synthesis with an analysis for the AVB class featuring IEEE 802.1Qbu frame preemption under different configurations to reduce the interference between the two classes. We first present a new worst-case response-time (WCRT) analysis for the AVB traffic class in TSN networks with preemption, considering an arbitrary number of AVB queues and different configurations for the CBS credit behavior. Then, we integrate the creation of ST schedule tables with the schedulability analysis of AVB traffic using a heuristic algorithm featuring frame preemption and a novel routing mechanism aimed at maximizing AVB schedulability. Finally, we evaluate our approach using both real-world and synthetic use cases showing the efficiency both in terms of schedule creation runtime and in terms of increasing the schedulability of lower-priority AVB traffic.  © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - Delay and jitter sensitive industrial control and remote driving application-driven network by best-effort to deterministic service. To meet the deterministic application of delay and jitter demands, industry and academia have conducted detailed research on stream filtering shaping and queue forwarding control. However, the study seldom considers the effects of long-distance topology change, transmission delay fluctuations and short-time traffic overloads, challenging to meet deterministic requirements under large-scale backbone networks. For this challenge, this paper based on Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding, considers source-destination path properties and deterministic traffic intensity. We propose Global Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding 3-Queue. In the deterministic network simulation system based on OMNeT, we constructed the actual network topology NSFNET, which has 14 nodes and 21 links. Experiments compare queue forwarding control mechanisms such as CQF and GCQF-3. The experimental results show that under the traffic matrix with 120% strength, the delay is reduced by 23.6%, the jitter is reduced by 53.6%, and the packet loss rate is reduced by 61%. It shows that GCQF-3 can timely adjust the gate-control and queueing priority according to the deterministic traffic state, achieves the best in delay, jitter and network utilization. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - This work explores a network architecture that combines the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm with a partitioning system for real-time networks based on the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards. The aim of the addressed architecture is to enforce temporal isolation for the flows already foreseen at the network design time, so that their delays are not affected by the introduction of new flows in the network at run time.

AB  - Compliance with the end-to-end latency of tasks and flows is a safety-relevant constraint in real-time systems. Especially when tasks and flows are interconnected by data dependencies in so-called Cause-Effect Chains, the adherence to end-to-end restrictions becomes even more complex. In our previous work, we proposed the incremental algorithm ITANS, which presents a solution for the joint scheduling of tasks and flows organized in Cause-Effect-Chains in communication networks applying the IEEE 802.1Qbv Time-Aware Shaper. In this work, we extend the approach to communication networks using the scheduling method Strict Priority (SP). The determination of the worst-case transmission time (WCTT) of flows is an essential part of ITANS. To derive the WCTT of flows in SP-based networks, we use the mathematical framework Network Calculus (NC) combining existing analyses to derive the least pessimistic delay guarantees for network flows. The evaluations show that the extension of ITANS can achieve a high success rate and a low runtime on average in systems with Gigabit Ethernet and communication networks that use SP.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Advances in automotive technology require networks to support a variety of communication requirements, such as reliability, real-time performance, low jitter, and strict delay limits. Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) is a keyframe transmission delay-guaranteed solution based on the IEEE 802 architecture of the automotive Ethernet. However, most of the existing studies on automotive TSN performance are based on a single mechanism, lacking a complete and systematic research tool. At the same time, the design method should be considered from a global perspective when designing an automotive TSN system, rather than only considering a single mechanism that TSN applies to. This paper discusses the correspondence between traffic types and automotive scenarios and proposes a methodology to target the delay constraint of traffic types as the design goal of automotive TSN networks. To study the performance of automotive TSN under different mechanisms such as time-aware shaper (TAS), credit-based shaper (CBS), cyclic queuing and forwarding (CQF), etc., this paper also develops a systematic automotive TSN simulation system based on OMNeT++. The simulation system plays a crucial role in the whole methodology, including all applicable TSN standards for the automotive field. Lastly, a complex automotive scenario based on zonal architecture provided by a major motor company in Shanghai is analyzed in the simulated system; verifying TSN can guarantee real-time performance and reliability of the in-vehicle network. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of standards offering bounded latency and jitter, low packet loss, and reliability for Ethernet-based systems while allowing best-effort and real-time traffic to coexist. Domains that use TSN include intra-vehicular networks (IVNs), aerospace, professional audio-video solutions, and smart manufacturing. All these areas shift towards Ethernet due to its scalability, throughput, easy to develop applications, and affordability to produce in a large scale. In this work, we devise a methodology that introduces a workflow comprising several steps to assess TSN in various domains. The first step defines requirements and assesses which real-time traffic is present within a given domain. The second step focuses on configuration of a representative TSN-based network. The step proceeds with performance evaluation of different TSN standards in the chosen configuration(s). The third - optional - step supports optimizing the system to fulfill the identified requirements. The methodology is generalized by assessing the various TSN domains and finding their commonalities. As a result, we see the methodology can be applied to other TSN solutions. We provide a detailed case study for the domain of IVNs, from which the methodology is derived. We summarize the key requirements, systematically analyze IVNs traffic patterns for real-time and best effort traffic, and evaluate the performance of crucial TSN standards recommended by the IEEE 802.1DG Automotive Profile. The methodology builds on top of infrastructure framework, EnGINE, that offers an environment for reproducible and scalable TSN experiments and relies on commercial off the shelf hardware and open-source solutions. The framework allows to evaluate various standards and identify suitable topologies with focus on Layer 2 solutions. Using EnGINE, we evaluated the various traffic patterns and their corresponding TSN configurations and identified if and how the IVN requirements can be fulfilled.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) evolves from Ethernet AVB in which the Credit-Based Shaping (CBS) is employed to guarantee the deterministic transmission of traffic. In CBS, the real-time performance of traffic associated with the credits can practicably settle the uncertainty of queueing and forwarding for stream-reservation traffic. Hence, the optimization of bandwidth allocation under the CBS becomes a key point to ensure guaranteed performance in the network. In this paper, a bandwidth allocation method is proposed for stream-reservation traffic while the real-time requirements are satisfied. We first illustrate the significance of appropriate bandwidth allocation for traffic under the CBS and construct a general schema for its bandwidth allocation. Also, the influences of the protected window for Control Data Traffic (CDT) on stream-reservation traffic are considered in our method. Further, mathematical models are constructed to analyze the delay bounds and backlogs of traffic to form the feedback for the optimal bandwidth allocation process. Finally, two node-level cases with different bandwidth utilization and a synthetic industrial networking scenario are carried out to demonstrate our method. The results confirm that the excessive reserved bandwidth does not necessarily decrease the delay bound, especially under the high traffic loads scenario. A more desirable bandwidth allocation strategy under the CBS mechanism is that the reserved bandwidth should be just enough according to the traffic loads to ensure the deterministic transmission of traffic. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Bandwidth-sharing policies aim at enforcing fairness among several classes of traffic by reserving one share of the available bandwidth for each class. They recently attracted a lot of attention, in particular in the context of time-sensitive networking. One advantage of these policies is their simplicity of implementation, especially the Round-Robin policies. Moreover, if a traffic class does not use all its reserved bandwidth, the other classes can use the unused part. Recent works greatly improve the delay bounds by considering this phenomenon for the Deficit Round-Robin policy, when the knowledge about the incoming traffic is available. There was also an attempt to use this approach for Weighted Round-Robin policy. Unfortunately, this was incorrect, mainly due to the variability of the packet lengths and the share of the bandwidth is not perfectly known. In this paper, we propose a generalization of bandwidth-sharing policies, that we call imperfect bandwidth sharing. We compute per-class service guarantees that correct and improves the state of the art on Round-Robin policies, and assess through numerical experiments the algorithmic and performance gain of our solution.  © 2023 IFIP.

AB  - Over recent years, traditional manufacturing factories have been accelerating their transformation and upgrade toward smart factories, which are an important concept within Industry 4.0. As a key communication technology in the industrial internet architecture, time-sensitive networks (TSNs) can break through communication barriers between subsystems within smart factories and form a common network for various network flows. Traditional routing algorithms are not applicable for this novel type of network, as they cause unnecessary congestion and latency. Therefore, this study examined the classification of TSN flows in smart factories, converted the routing problem into two graphical problems, and proposed two heuristic optimization algorithms, namely GATTRP and AACO, to find the optimal solution. The experiments showed that the algorithms proposed in this paper could provide a more reasonable routing arrangement for various TSN flows with different time sensitivities. The algorithms could effectively reduce the overall delay by up to 74% and 41%, respectively, with promising operating performances. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Industrial automation applications enforce strict requirements on the automation network, such as strict timing, upper bounded latency, low jitter, and essentially zero loss. Time sensitive networking (TSN) is an enabling technology for future automation networks. While most studies on TSN for industrial applications have focused on simple approaches to performance evaluation, we provide a comprehensive simulation based analysis for a typical industrial use case. We specify the network traffic produced by automation applications and associated TSN traffic classes. We model different network configurations such as priority queuing, time aware shaping, and credit based shaping to study how they meet the delay constraints of the different traffic classes. To evaluate the performance of our TSN based industrial network, we build and configured a network model and a set of application traffic models to generate realistic network traffic together with defined network design goals in OMNET ++. Our simulation results show that a TSN based network meets all application requirements.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we consider that critical control applications and Fog applications share a Fog Computing Platform (FCP). Critical control applications are implemented as periodic hard real-time tasks and messages and have stringent timing and safety requirements, and require safety certification. Fog applications are implemented as aperiodic tasks and messages and are not critical. Such applications need different approaches to guarantee their timing and dependability requirements. We formulate an optimization problem for the joint configuration of critical control and Fog applications, such that (i) the deadlines and Quality-of-Control (QoC) of control applications are guaranteed at design-time, (ii) the configuration is extensible and supports the addition of future new control applications without requiring costly re-certification, and (iii) the design-time configuration together with the runtime Fog resource management mechanisms, can successfully accommodate multiple dynamic responsive Fog applications. We evaluate our approach on several test cases assuming scenarios for hosting both Fog applications and future critical control applications. The results show that our approach generates extensible schedules which enables Fog nodes to handle Fog applications with a shorter response time and a larger number of future control applications. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Owning to the sub-standards being developed by IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group, the traditional IEEE 802.1 Ethernet is enhanced to support real-time dependable communications for future time-A nd safety-critical applications. Several sub-standards have been recently proposed that introduce various traffic shapers (e.g., Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), Asynchronous Traffic Shaper (ATS), Credit-Based Shaper (CBS), Strict Priority (SP)) for flow control mechanisms of queuing and scheduling, targeting different application requirements. These shapers can be used in isolation or combination and there is limited work that analyzes, evaluates, and compares their performance, which makes it challenging for end-users to choose the right combination for their applications. This paper aims at (i) quantitatively comparing various traffic shapers and their combinations, (ii) summarizing, classifying, and extending the architectures of individual and combined traffic shapers and their Network calculus (NC)-based performance analysis methods, and (iii) filling the gap in the timing analysis research on handling ATS and CBS used for different priority queues, and two novel hybrid architectures of combined traffic shapers, i.e., TAS+ATS+SP and TAS+ATS+CBS when ATS and CBS used at the same queue. A large number of experiments, using both synthetic and realistic test cases, are carried out for quantitative performance comparisons of various individual and combined traffic shapers, from the perspective of upper bounds of delay, backlog, and jitter. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to quantitatively compare the performance of the main traffic shapers in TSN. The paper aims at supporting the researchers and practitioners in the selection of suitable TSN sub-protocols for their use cases. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Network technologies are being developed to increase not only performance of data communication but also for provision of deterministic guarantees. Such designs foster the development of distributed real-time applications. When networks must provide time-sensitive communication, a commonly found design feature is First-In First-Out (FIFO) - a natural design for multiplexing different data flows into queues and for scheduling queued data. Alongside technological advancements, there is the development of formal tools to reason about timing behavior. Network Calculus is such a methodology. It has been widely adopted already and its modeling capabilities were extended to features found in modern standards as, e.g., in IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking. However, the basic challenge to compute a deterministic bound on a flow's worst-case end-to-end delay in FIFO networks still imposes challenges. Different analyses exist but often offer limited scalability. In this paper, we present an analysis with a readily tunable tradeoff between quality of the delay bound and the computational effort it imposes. We combine a greedy algorithm with an iterative directed search whose termination criterion can be adapted, e.g., subject to the analyzed network size. Our approach provides bounds of competitive quality at smaller computational cost than current alternatives for the analysis of feedforward FIFO networks.  © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - Recent work on automotive communications based on the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards proposed an approach to handle all the real-time frames in a uniform way regardless of their arrival pattern. According to such an approach, instead of binding all the frames of the same flow to a traffic class, each periodic or event-driven frame is scheduled based on its absolute deadline according to the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) algorithm. The approach does not impose additional frame overhead and does not require complex offline configurations that would be unsuitable for event-driven traffic. However, EDF scheduling cannot support time-driven communications. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a framework that combines the flexibility of online EDF frame scheduling for both periodic and event-driven traffic with the ability to guarantee temporal isolation to time-driven traffic. The paper describes the design of the proposed approach and the performance obtained using the OMNeT++ simulation environment. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Existing response time analysis and optimization techniques for real-time distributed systems show that EDF schedulers feature better scheduling capabilities when a global clock reference can be used; this form of scheduling is known as global-clock EDF. In this context, precise clock synchronization is an enabling technology for future distributed real-time systems that want to leverage EDF scheduling. The IEEE 802.1AS protocol can be considered a stable technology for this purpose, as it is part of the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) family of standards to provide real-time communication over Ethernet. This paper presents a system architecture for applying global-clock EDF scheduling in distributed systems with soft real-time requirements. It also presents experiments to (1) assess the synchronization capabilities of the clock synchronization mechanism in the proposed architecture, (2) evaluate the performance of different scheduling deadline assignment techniques, and (3) contrast the theoretical results obtained by the schedulability analysis against those obtained through the execution of these experiments. © 2022

AB  - In flexible production systems with distributed control systems which communicate with each other via a real time network, changes in the requirements for real time communication during operation must not lead to a temporary failure of the deterministic communication. Rather, the changes of the network configuration must become active at exactly predictable times in order to guarantee the functionality of the deterministic communication all the time. This paper shows a realization of how the configuration of a real time network schedule under Linux can be adjusted at predetermined times without interrupting the communication. For this purpose, the real time scheduler TAPRIO is integrated into the library libnl, and the performance of this extension is evaluated in a test case. It is shown that the modification of the network configuration is reliably possible in several successive communication cycles.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN) enhance standard IEEE 802.1Q Ethernet devices with real-time and time-aware capabilities. The forwarding of time-critical frames is done according to a so-called Gate Control List (GCL) schedule via the timed-gate mechanism introduced in IEEE 802.1Qbv. Most TSN scheduling mechanisms impose that all devices in the network must have the TSN capabilities related to scheduled gates and time synchronization. However, this is often an unrealistic assumption since many distributed applications use heterogeneous TSN networks with legacy or off-the-shelf end systems that are unscheduled and/or unsynchronized. This paper proposes a novel, more flexible TSN scheduling algorithm that intertwines a worst-case delay analysis within the scheduling synthesis step. Through this, we leverage the solution's optimality to support heterogeneous TSN networks featuring unscheduled and/or unsynchronized end-systems while still guaranteeing the timeliness of critical communication. We evaluate the performance of our approach using both synthetic and real-world use cases, comparing it with existing TSN scheduling mechanisms. Furthermore, we use OMNET++ to validate the generated GCL schedules.  © 2022 ACM.

AB  - The digitization of industrial automation processes calls for flexible, adaptable, and scalable communication solutions to enable the vision of a true 'cyber-physical system.' In this context, IEEE iime-sensitive networking (TSN), developed by the Time-Sensitive Networking task group of the IEEE 802.1 working group, is receiving particular interest as it defines mechanisms for the time-sensitive (i.e. deterministic) transmission of data over Ethernet networks. In order to enable novel use cases and further improve the efficiency of industrial automation, mobile and wireless solutions are needed. Here, 3GPP Release 16 supports applications requiring deterministic communication or isochronous communication with high reliability and availability, such as IEEE TSN, over wireless networks. In this article, the focus lies specifically on the end-to-end latency performance of an integrated IEEE TSN and 3GPP 5G system. The article shows how 3GPP 5G can utilize information provided by an IEEE TSN in order to optimize its operation and provide very low end-to-end delays. Furthermore, the article illustrates the impact of individual IEEE 802.1 features on the end-to-end performance when being integrated with a 3GPP 5G System.  © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In deterministic time-aware networks, such as TTEthernet (TTE) and Time Sensitive Networking (TSN), time-triggered (TT) communication are often routed and scheduled without taking into account other critical traffic such as Rate-Constrained (RC) traffic. Consequently, the impact of a static transmission schedule for TT traffic can prevent RC traffic from fulfilling their timing constraints. In this paper, we present a general framework for routing, scheduling and formal timing analysis (FTA) in deterministic time-aware networks (e.g. TSN, TTE). The general framework drives an iterative execution of different modules (i.e. routing, scheduling and FTA) searching for a solution that fulfills an arbitrary number of defined constraints (e.g. maximum end-to-end RC and TT latency) and optimization goals (e.g. minimize reception jitter). The result is an iteratively improved solution including the routing configuration for TT and RC flows, the static TT schedule, a formal analysis for the RC traffic, as well as any additional outputs satisfying user constraints (e.g. maximum RC jitter). We then do a performance evaluation of the general framework, with a proposed implementation of the necessary modules for TTEthernet networks with mixed time-triggered and rate-constrained traffic. The evaluation of our studied realistic use case shows that, using the general framework, the end-to-end latency for RC traffic can be reduced up to 28.3%, and the number of flows not fulfilling their deadlines divided by up to 3 compared to existing methods. © Anaïs Finzi and Ramon Serna Oliver

AB  - A time-sensitive network (TSN) extends the conventional Ethernet to support time-sensitive data flow. Thus, it enables simultaneous transmission of high reliability (HR) flow, medium reliability (MR) flow, and low reliability (LR) flow on the same network, thereby improving the reliability of data transmission. A TSN is a symmetric network that connects sensors and other facilities. As a backbone network, it can efficiently connect the underlying sensors and other levels of facilities, as well as ensure the quality of service of the network. For modern supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, several types of sensors are widely used. The acquisition cycle of sensors for different purposes varies significantly from milliseconds to seconds. Moreover, these data also have different real-time requirements. Based on satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), this study proposes a TSN routing and scheduling method by adding related scheduling constraints. Compared with other methods, the proposed method can realize the routing and scheduling of hybrid flow in a hyper period and consider MR flow and LR flow, which improves the feasibility and certainty of data flow interaction between substations. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The change of industrial automation towards a highly interconnected architecture is still ongoing. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an essential element for this transition. This paper focuses on TSN end stations, mainly answering how to implement a software-based worst-case execution time (WCET) analyzable buffer management. The two-level segregated fit (TLSF) algorithm was chosen, implemented, and evaluated based on an asymptotic complexity analysis of dynamic storage allocation algorithms. The implemented and improved TLSF algorithm showed similar timing behavior as calculated when executed on a time-predictable platform. The paper concludes by outlining further research.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The traffic scheduling mechanism in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is the key to guaranteeing the deterministic transmission of traffic. However, when time-sensitive traffic and non-time-sensitive traffic are transmitted together, traffic scheduling conflicts are easy to occur in TSN. As a result, the deterministic transmission of time-sensitive traffic will be disrupted, and non-time-sensitive traffic may be preempted for a long time. To optimize the performance of multi-type hybrid traffic scheduling in TSN, we firstly establish a collaborative scheduling framework that incorporates Time Aware Shaping (TAS) and Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) mechanisms. We then design a traffic shaping method in this framework based on Least Laxity First (LLF), which considers traffic characteristics to dynamically arrange the time slot injection sequence for different types of traffic. Finally, the traffic schedulability is evaluated based on the scheduling constraints of different types of traffic. Compared with the existing scheduling strategies, the proposed hybrid traffic scheduling strategy can schedule more non-time-sensitive traffic and achieve better delay performance of rate-constrained traffic in different hybrid traffic scenarios. When the number of flows is 100, the time slot injection ratio is increased by 24.3% compared with the LLF_TAS method. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is used in time-critical systems because of its high-bandwidth and time determinization. To ensure the deterministic transmission of Time-Triggered (TT) flows, TSN adopts the guard band mechanism to control the next pending frame not be transmitted on the link before transmitting TT flows, thereby preventing interference from Audio-Video-Bridging (AVB) and Best-Effort (BE) flows. However, this mechanism causes the transmission delay of AVB flows and the waste of bandwidth. To reduce the above negative impacts, the state-of-the-art method selects BE flows at the head of each queue to occupy the guard band, but the acceptance rate of flows and bandwidth utilization are still low. This paper proposes a low-delay AVB flow scheduling method occupying the guard band to improve the acceptance rate of AVB flows and bandwidth utilization. The method selects AVB flows from all flows in the queue to occupy the guard band, and it includes the Maximum Transmission for AVB Flows (MTAF) algorithm and the Maximum Bandwidth Utilization (MBU) algorithm. MTAF algorithm fills AVB flows with the earliest deadline into the guard band to increase the acceptance rate, and the MBU algorithm maximizes the size of AVB flows occupying the guard band to improve bandwidth utilization. Experiments show that the proposed algorithms improve the acceptance rate of AVB flows and bandwidth utilization compared to the state-of-the-art method. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - IEEE 802.1 Qbv time-aware shaper (TAS) has been developed for delivery of time-critical periodic frames of time-triggered (TT) flows over Ethernet under strict end-to-end latency and jitter bounds. Efficient routing and flow scheduling are critical for successful deployments of TAS systems. Although many routing and flow scheduling schemes for TAS have been proposed so far, most of them are restricted to single path routing and zero jitter delivery. Multipath routing and nonzero jitter bound could provide more flexibility in scheduling thus increase scheduling success. However they have been rarely studied in TAS scheduling. In this work, online incremental routing and scheduling schemes utilizing multipath routing and nonzero jitter bound are proposed based on no-wait packet switching mechanism for TAS. Two routing and scheduling schemes with nonzero jitter bound are proposed, i.e., incremental single path routing and scheduling with nonzero jitter bound (ISPRS-NZJ) and incremental multipath routing and scheduling with nonzero jitter bound (IMPRS-NZJ). Both schemes are based on the proposed resource-centric scheduling approach in which information on feasible free time-slices in the paths for a TT flow is updated according to flow scheduling result and used for scheduling of next flow. Paths for a flow are searched by depth-first way and cumulative free time-slices (CFTSs) in each link of a path are found and used in ISPRS-NZJ. In IMPRS-NZJ, combined cumulative free time-slices (CCFTSs) are obtained from CFTSs and used for scheduling. Numerical results show that scheduling with nonzero jitter bound or multipath routing could reduce schedule failure rates compared with typical single path scheduling with zero jitter bound. Also it is shown that scheduling with nonzero jitter bound is more effective in reducing schedule failure rates than scheduling with multipath routing.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Packet replication and elimination functions are used by time-sensitive networks (as in the context of IEEE TSN and IETF DetNet) to increase the reliability of the network. Packets are replicated onto redundant paths by a replication function. Later the paths merge again and an elimination function removes the duplicates. This redundancy scheme has an effect on the timing behavior of time-sensitive networks and many challenges arise from conducting timing analyses. The replication can induce a burstiness increase along the paths of replicates, as well as packet mis-ordering that could increase the delays in the crossed bridges or routers. The induced packet mis-ordering could also negatively affect the interactions between the redundancy and scheduling mechanisms such as traffic regulators (as with per-flow regulators and interleaved regulators, implemented by TSN asynchronous traffic shaping). Using the network calculus framework, we provide a method of worst-case timing analysis for time-sensitive networks that implement redundancy mechanisms in the general use case, i.e., at end-devices and/or intermediate nodes. We first provide a network calculus toolbox for bounding the burstiness increase and the amount of reordering caused by the elimination function of duplicate packets. We then analyze the interactions with traffic regulators and show that their shaping-for-free property does not hold when placed after a packet elimination function. We provide a bound for the delay penalty when using per-flow regulators and prove that the penalty is not bounded with interleaved regulators. Finally, we use an industrial use-case to show the applicability and the benefits of our findings.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - This paper deals with the integration of OPC UA over Wireless / Wired (Hybrid) Networks with Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) capabilities. We propose a HW/SW device architecture, based on the SHARP platform, to enable the integration of OPC UA and Hybrid TSN. The integration includes both the OPC UA Client/Server and PubSub mechanism. Based on the device architecture, we built a HW testbed that integrated Hybrid TSN and OPC UA to assess its performance. The results demonstrate that the network can provide seamless application interoperability and that can satisfy the traffic needs in a typical industrial setup. However, the paper also highlights that there is still significant research to be done to achieve deep integration between OPC UA and Hybrid TSN.  © 2023 IFIP.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) extends traditional Ethernet to support data traffic with ultra-reliability and time-critical requirements for a range of applications in industrial automation, automotive, and aerospace. The TSN standards present guidelines to integrate different types of data traffic over a single converged network. Therefore, it is becoming an enabling technology towards the Industry 4.0 vision of integrating information and operational technologies within future Industrial Internet of Things networks. In this paper, we develop a network calculus based framework to analyse TSN based industrial networks supporting a range of data traffic classes. We apply the framework to study and analyse a well-known industrial use case, Quality Checks After Production (QCAP), with four data traffic types with different requirements in terms of reliability and end-to-end latency. In our evaluation, we validate our framework with a computer simulation model and compare the tightness of the calculated delay bounds to a state-of-the-art approach. We then use our model to analyse the upper bounds on the worst-case delay of the different QCAP traffic types and assess the factors that impact end-to-end delay, e.g. flow offset and critical links. Finally, we compare various credit accumulation rates and their impact on the traffic delay bounds.  © 2023 IFIP.

AB  - The increasing connectivity and autonomy of vehicles has led to a growing need for dynamic and real-time adjustments to software and network configurations. Software Defined Vehicles (SDV) have emerged as a potential solution to adapt to changing user needs with continuous updates and onboard reconfigurations to offer infotainment, connected, and background services such as cooperative driving. However, network configuration management in SDVs remains a significant challenge, particularly in the context of shared Ethernet-based in-vehicle networks. Traditional worst-case static configuration methods cannot efficiently allocate network resources while ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for each network flow within the physical topology capabilities. In this work, we propose a configuration generation methodology that addresses these limitations by dynamically switching between pre-computed offboard configurations downloaded to the vehicle. Simulation results are presented and future work is discussed.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we unveil the Software-Defined Low Latency (SDLL) framework based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to provision the Quality of Service (QoS) and guarantee ultra-low latency in 5G and beyond Transport Networks (TN). SDLL aims to tackle Time Sensitive Networking (TSN)'s weaknesses by providing agility and flexibility in terms of Traffic Engineering (TE) and Queue Management (QM) to guarantee low end-to-end (E2E) latency even under congested links. SDLL provides a flexible and on-demand way to change end-to-end paths and queue configurations (ex., add or remove queues). We conducted extensive experimentation by implementing SDLL using Open Network Operating System (ONOS) and Open vSwitch (OVS) tools and comparing its performances against two standard solutions: SDN Shortest Path (SDNSP) (one queue per port) and Software-Defined QoS (SDQoS) (three queues per port). Obtained results indicate that SDLL can guarantee low E2E latency compared to the two other solutions, particularly when: (1) the links are congested and (2) many low-latency critical services are run in parallel.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - UAVs have the qualities of large coverage, flexible deployment, scalability, low cost and easy programming. Myriad UAVs are flexibly deployed in the air, on the ground and even on submarines, enabling ubiquitous connectivity. Thus, UAV-assisted IoT is considered a potential solution to support time-sensitive applications in sixth-generation (6G) networks. Such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), smart homes, smart cities and self-driving vehicles. A large amount of sensor data will be collected and carried by drones for transmission to destination nodes for further processing and analysis. Unlike traditional broadband services, most IoT applications transmit short and time-varying data packets carrying sensor updates. Many studies on time-sensitive applications at this stage still focus on optimization of latency, reliability and other metrics. Less attention has been paid to the freshness of the updates and the timeliness of the data. Age of Information (AoI) is a new metric introduced for time-sensitive applications in recent years. Unlike latency, which represents real-time, AoI utilizes the concept of freshness to depict the timeliness of data. The larger the AoI, the less fresh and timely the information is. To better serve time-sensitive applications, we cannot reduce the stringent requirements for latency while ensuring data timeliness. Therefore, we propose Freshness-based Admission in First Out (FAIFO), a novel fine-grained programmable packet scheduling scheme. FAIFO can guarantee the freshness of information for time-sensitive applications while meeting their low-latency requirements. FAIFO first uses the concept of admission control to rapidly filter high-priority (low-latency) packets into queue A to meet the real-time requirements of time-sensitive applications. Subsequently, depending on the freshness level of the packets, FAIFO will decide whether the discarded packets need to be cached in queue B to meet the timeliness requirements of time-sensitive applications. Finally, we improve the credit-based shaper (CBS) algorithm to perform traffic shaping on packets in queue A and queue B to ensure that high-priority queue A is forwarded first and freshness queue B is forwarded in a timely manner. Simulation experiments compare FAIFO with the ideal benchmark Push-In-First-Out (PIFO), state-of-the-art SP-PIFO, and AIFO. The results indicate that our FAIFO can also obtain the approximate PIFO effect, and the delay guarantee is comparable to SP-PIFO and AIFO. More importantly, FAIFO's guarantee of information freshness is significantly better than other compared algorithms. © 2022

AB  - The frame preemption mechanism in Time-Sensitive Networking can effectively improve the transmission latency performance of express frames. However, in different network operating environments, express frame latency presents complex dynamic characteristics. In response to the complexity of express frame latency characteristics under frame preemption conditions, this article first analyzes the operation principle of the frame preemption mechanism and provides a calculation method for the latency of express frames. Then, considering the impact of link utilization and preemptable frame length on the average latency of express frames, we design a simulation analysis algorithm for the latency characteristics of express frames. Finally, using the proposed algorithm, we analyze the average latency, latency randomness, jitter, and latency boundary characteristics of express frames. The research results are valuable for engineering reference for the effective application of the TSN network frame preemption mechanism.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Most of the recent researches related to hybrid traffic scheduling in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) focus on how to ensure bounded low-delay transmission for Scheduled Traffic (ST) and Stream Reservation (SR) traffic. However, if high-priority traffic blocks Best Effort (BE) traffic represented by data logging and periodic software updates for a long time, the end-to-end delay of BE messages will be too large. To reduce the blocking of SR traffic on BE traffic by reducing the reserved bandwidth for SR traffic, this paper proposes a traffic scheduling algorithm combined with ingress shaping. First, add ingress buffers before SR queues. Then, schedule SR traffic on a per-flow basis in the TSN switch by limiting the rate at which frames in each ingress buffer enter the SR queue. Finally, joint egress shaping and ingress shaping to reserve bandwidth resources that match its delay requirement for each SR flow. Simulation results show that the maximum end-to-end delay of BE messages can be reduced by 0.32%17.19%. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - In order to improve the real-time performance of Industrial Internet, this paper proposes a network communication delay optimization scheme that based on the IEEE 802.1Qbv protocol of time sensitive network (TSN). The scheme distinguishes the network data types with different time delay requirements, and proposes a TAS-EWRR scheduling algorithm in the data link layer of OSI model. The algorithm combines with time aware shaper (TAS), stream reservation protocol (SRP), frame preemption mechanism and enhanced weighted round robin (EWRR) algorithm. At the same time, a shortest path algorithm based on delay is combined at the network layer to realize the optimization of the delay of the entire network. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - With the increasing of distributed energy resources, in order to ensure system security and flexibility, the same switching device must support the mixed transmission of multiple streams. Therefore, the mechanism of hybrid streaming is urgently needed. The IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Force is working to standardize key mechanisms to enable simultaneous coexistence of time-sensitive and non-time-sensitive flows in Ethernet. In this paper, we propose a hybrid traffic scheduling mechanism for HFSM-C. This mechanism combines TAS with CQF, and utilizes flow ordering, injection slot adjustment and the simple compensation mechanism proposed in this paper to schedule time-sensitive flow and large-bandwidth flow respectively. Through experiments, we found that the HFSM-C mechanism significantly improves the schedule-ability compared with other mechanisms, and under the same TSN system settings, it schedules more flows than the HSTC mechanism, the FITS mechanism and the Tabu-ITP mechanism when scheduling large-bandwidth flows, the success rate is higher, and the efficient scheduling of mixed flows is realized.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The emergence of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has enabled network determinism to a new level, offering high reliability and bounded latency for critical communications. However, the unpredictable nature of traffic generation also poses new challenges to TSN. While TSN is designed to maintain backward compatibility with the 802.1 standards, many end nodes may not be equipped to understand TSN. This can result in a less deterministic TSN, and suboptimal resource utilization, mainly driven by Residual Service Time (RST). To address these challenges, this study proposes three scheduling mechanisms to reduce RST: q-learning, active time slot update, and polynomial forecasting. Real-world data captured from our wireless-TSN (W-TSN) evaluation kit is used to compare the proposed approaches in terms of one-way latency. The results show that the machine learning approach outperforms the other methods in terms of overall latency. However, it is less effective in identifying the optimal time slot position compared to the other methods.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The rapid development of automobile intelligent driving has led to a gradual increase in data traffic and the number of ECUs, thus raising the requirements for high-bandwidth and low-latency for automotive electrical/electronic (E/E) network architectures. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is used in intelligent automobiles and is served as the backbone network because it can provide real-time communication with high capacity. To achieve the high-bandwidth transmission of data traffic, message packing is one of the prospective strategies. However, the state-of-the-art message packing methods mainly consider the single bus type rather than the hybrid bus type. In this paper, we exploit a heuristic message packing strategy (MA) for real-time traffic based on the multi-domain Electrica/Electronic (E/E) network architecture. Experiment results show that the MA method can significantly reduce bandwidth utilization. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - For the problem of using time-aware shaping combined with credit shaping-based hybrid traffic scheduling to achieve efficient transmission of hybrid streams, an improvement of CBS shaper based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed. By setting appropriate reward values, this mechanism greatly satisfies the different requirements of time delay for various types of audio and video streams and greatly reduces the delay and loss rate of BE streams without affecting the Time Triggered Flow (TT). The experimental results show that the algorithm improves the delay of AVB streams under the worst conditions. At the same time, the minimum delay and jitter are greatly improved compared with the classical model. © 2022 ACM.

AB  - Recent trends such as automated driving in the automotive field and digitization in factory automation confront designers of real-time systems with new challenges. These challenges have arisen due to the increasing amount of data and an intensified interconnection of functions. For distributed safety-critical systems, this progression has the impact that the complexity of scheduling tasks with precedence constraints organized in so-called cause-effect chains increases the more data has to be exchanged between tasks and the more functions are involved. Especially when data has to be transmitted over an Ethernet-based communication network, the coordination between the tasks running on different end-devices and the network flows has to be ensured to meet strict end-to-end deadlines. In this work, we present an incremental heuristic approach that computes schedules for distributed and data-dependent cause-effect chains consisting of multi-rate tasks and network flows in time-sensitive networks. On the one hand, we provide a common task model for tasks and network flows. On the other hand, we introduce the concept of earliest and latest start times to speed up the solution discovery process and to discard infeasible solutions at an early stage. Our algorithm is able to solve large problems for synthetic network topologies with randomized data dependencies in a few seconds on average under strict end-to-end deadlines. We have achieved a high success rate for multi-rate cause-effect chains and an even better result for homogeneous or harmonic chains. Our approach also showed low jitter for homogeonous cause-effect chains.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) standard was introduced to provide deterministic Ethernet-based communication for industrial distributed systems. However, configuration needs to be done manually and is error prone. Combining TSN with the IEC 61499 modeling standard opens up new opportunities for automatic network configuration. A prerequisite is to have an in depth understanding of the requirements for a TSN/IEC 61499 control system and especially of the communication time behavior. We developed a time measurement concept to analyze the timing effects on three important layers under different traffic configurations. We deployed our IEC 61499 implementation on two directly connected Intel I210 evaluation boards based on a minimized Linux Operating System to reduce non-deterministic external influences. The results show the expected effect of using a TSN configuration and a particularly positive impact with TSN transmission windows that are long enough for the IEC 61499 application, especially at the receiving device. The measured delays are shorter for the IEC 61499 application when it is scheduled as time-critical with competing traffic compared to when it runs without a TSN schedule and competing traffic. This is evidence that IEC 61499 performs very well together with a TSN configuration, which opens the door for automatic network configuration in IEC 61499 Ethernet/TSN control applications.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Dampers are devices that reduce delay jitter in the context of time-sensitive networks, by delaying packets for the amount written in packet headers. Jitter reduction is required by some real-time applications; beyond this, dampers have the potential to solve the burstiness cascade problem of deterministic networks in a scalable way, as they can be stateless. Dampers exist in several variants: some apply only to earliest-deadline-first schedulers, whereas others can be associated with any packet schedulers; some enforce FIFO ordering whereas some others do not. Existing analyses of dampers are specific to some implementations and some network configurations; also, they assume ideal, non-realistic clocks. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of all existing dampers in general network settings and analyze their timing properties in presence of non-ideal clocks. In particular, we give formulas for computing residual jitter bounds of networks with dampers of any kind. We show that non-FIFO dampers may cause reordering due to clock non-idealities and that the combination of FIFO dampers with non-FIFO network elements may very negatively affect the performance bounds. Our results can be used to analyze timing properties and burstiness increase in any time-sensitive network, as we illustrate on an industrial case-study. © 1993-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Smart grid substation automation and protection applications are time-critical, since any real time constraint violation may result in disastrous consequences. However, meeting real time requirements in Substation Communication Networks (SCN) is a challenging issue. To address the various real time requirements, the IEC 61850 standard specifies several application protocols that were based on Ethernet but is recently moving to TSN (Time Sensitive Networking). This raises the following question: is TSN always relevant for SCN? This paper attempts to answer this question through a comparison of traditional switched Ethernet and the Time Aware Shaper (TAS) mechanism associated with the TSN standard. We highlight the difficulty in answering the question simulating scenarios in which TAS is relevant and others in which it is not. We conclude by making some recommendations for using the TAS of TSN in SCN.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is an emerging network technique used in real-time communication. There are three typical traffic types in TSN: Time-Triggered (TT) traffic with strict time stability requirements, Audio-Video-Bridging (AVB) traffic with large bandwidth and bounded latency requirements, and Best-Effort (BE) traffic. This paper presents an analytical latency model for AVB traffic in TSN considering TT traffic. According to the time-slots of TT traffic, an accurate single-hop service curve for AVB traffic is established based on Network Calculus, from which a more precise queueing delay through one hop can be calculated. Moreover, a strict worst-case end-to-end latency of AVB traffic can be obtained by the calculated queueing delays. We evaluate the proposed model in a real network environment, and the results show that the proposed model is more accurate and more accordance with actual circumstance compared with other methods.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - There is a demand of high bandwidth in the emerging real-time applications, such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and industrial automation, where time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a promising solution. According to IEEE 802.1, a port in a TSN switch has eight prioritized FIFO (first-in first-out) queues, whose gates are opened or closed following a gate control list (GCL). Most of the existing works use one TT (time-triggered) queue for the hard real-time traffic, i.e., traffic flows with hard deadlines, which easily achieves timing determinism through GCL. Unfortunately, as a rigid mechanism, GCL is not able to handle timing jitter. In this work, we propose a hybrid strategy towards robust TSN. GCL is applied to only one queue named TT T1 for a small number of hard real-time flows with negligible jitter. The remaining flows with hard deadlines are allocated to a prioritized queue named TT T2 without GCL. Similarly, GCL is removed from all other queues handling AVB (audio-video-bridging) flows with soft deadlines and BE (best-effort) flows with no deadlines. Two analyses are proposed to obtain delay bounds for the TT T2 flows and periodic AVB flows, respectively, with interference from TT T1. Although safety is not compromised if the periodic AVB flows miss their deadlines, it is often desirable in practice to satisfy them for quality of service. In order to strike a balance, contention between the AVB queues is resolved with credit values on top of priorities. Experiments support that the delay bounds for the TT T2 and AVB flows are safe. In addition, changing the credit function can lead to different delay bounds of AVB flows, which is valuable for real-world configurations of TSN. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of IEEE 802.1 technologies that support real-time and reliable Ethernet communication, commonly used in automotive and industrial automation systems. Time-aware scheduling is adopted in TSN to achieve high temporal predictability. In this paper, we demonstrate that such a scheduling solution alone does not always meet all timing requirements and must be combined with network preemption support. We propose an SMT-based synthesis method for preemptive time-triggered scheduling and routing in TSN. Our experiments demonstrate that schedulability is improved significantly when using frame preemption compared to a standard time-triggered message scheduling approach.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) set of standards introduces in IEEE 802.1 switches and end stations novel features to meet the requirements of a broad spectrum of applications that are characterized by time-sensitive and mission-critical traffic flows. In particular, the IEEE802.1Qbv-2015 amendment introduces enhancements that provide temporal isolation for scheduled traffic, i.e., a traffic class that requires transmission based on a known timescale, while the IEEE802.1Qbu-2016 introduces preemption as a mechanism to allow time-critical messages to interrupt ongoing non time-critical transmissions. Both amendments, that are now enrolled in the IEEE802.1Q-2018 standard, are very important for industrial networks, where scheduled traffic and low-latency real-time flows have to coexist, on the same network, with best-effort transmissions. In this context, this work presents a response time analysis of TSN networks that encompasses the enhancements for scheduled traffic and preemption, in various combinations. The paper presents the proposed analysis and a performance comparison between the response times calculated by the analysis and the response times obtained through OMNeT++ simulations in three different scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The need to dynamically assign capacity to various network slices in virtualized C-RAN enabled 5G and beyond packet-switched networks require the added fronthaul network to be able to deliver standard bitrates. We therefore design a novel fronthaul network scheduling architecture and scheme based off the Burst Limiting Shaper (BLS) mechanism to provide Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to service differential traffic which include ultra Reliable and Low Latency communication (URLLC) traffic and non-URLLC traffic In this work we compare our strategy to Weighted Round Robin (WRR) scheduling algorithm under bursty and low traffic conditions. Simulations are used to evaluate our schemes performance ad show how well it compares to WRR.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Time sensitive networks (TSNs) enable deterministic real-time communication over Ethernet networks. According to IEEE 802.1Qbv standards, TSN switches use gates between queues and their corresponding egress ports to facilitate timing-deterministic communications. Management of switch resources, such as queues, has a significant impact on the schedulability of real-time flows. In this paper, we look into the theoretical foundation of queue management in TSN switches. We prove that the queue assignment problem for real-time flows on time sensitive networks under static priority scheduling is NP-hard in the strong sense, even if the number of queues per port is 3. Then we formulate the problem as a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) specification. Besides, we propose a worst case response time analysis and a fast heuristic algorithms by eliminating scheduling conflicts. Experiments with randomly generated workload demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms for queue assignment of real-time flows. © 2021

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a cluster of protocols working in the data link layer of the OSI reference model, which has been introduced into the industrial Internet due to its ability to ensure the deterministic transmission of data. Through IEEE 802.1AS clock synchronization and IEEE 802.1 Qbv gating mechanism, TSN networks allocate separate transmission time slots for periodic signals to ensure low delay and jitter, but this increases the delay of aperiodic stream to some extent. In this paper, a scheduling scheme of Grouping transmission is proposed. By changing the sending time of periodic data stream, the periodic data stream which is originally continuously transmitted is divided into several groups to be transmitted in different time periods in a cycle, so as to reduce the real-time aperiodic data stream delay. Experimental results show that the proposed scheduling scheme can reduce the transmission delay of the non-periodic traffic without affecting the quality of service (QoS) of the periodic traffic. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: The communication architecture within an aircraft needs to support high speed data requirements with reduced wiring weight. With Time Sensitive Networking, we can have multiple gateways and interfaces for each subsystem, which substantially reduces point to point communication. Methods: In this study, we have used a System Level Modelling Tool called VisualSim Architect for evaluating various use cases and validating the results. Results: By using Ethernet as the backbone helped in providing very high bandwidth for critical and non-critical applications. By applying Time Sensitive Networking protocols, a deterministic behavior for time critical applications were observed. Further, it was found that by adding AI algorithms to shape the traffic and time slots increased the reliability. Conclusion: From the results of various use cases, it was seen that even with Time Sensitive Networking, few of the critical applications misses their time slot and as a result a spike in latency plots were observed. In order to prevent slot misses, dynamic time slot configuration as well as credit configuration with the help of AI algorithms were considered and the results obtained helped validate this statement. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Dependable, safety-critical real-time (SCRT) systems are becoming increasingly important and complex. Examples of such systems are autonomous or self-driving cars which are poised to revolutionise the transport industry. A critical part of these SCRT systems is the network communication protocol that is used by components in an SCRT system to exchange data. Communication protocols for SCRT systems are required to exhibit predictable, worst-case execution times and thus have to be designed in a more static and less flexible way. To ensure this predictability, current state-of-art communication protocols for SCRT systems are based on the Time-Triggered Architecture (TTA), where static and equal-length time-slots are used for all nodes to access the communication channel, irrespective of the size of their transmission payload. This determinism forms the basis of predictable timing, behaviour and fault tolerance. However, this determinism comes at the cost of poor channel and bandwidth utilisation, which hinders the development of SCRT systems. In this paper, we propose a more flexible approach, INCUS+, that allocates the slot length of a node based on its transmission requirements in a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) round. We achieve this while retaining the level of dependability required for SCRT systems and ensuring fail-silence. We validate this through formal verification of the timing parameters for the transmission windows of all participating nodes as well as independent bus guardians. Our design exhibits a significant improvement in bandwidth and channel utilisation, as we demonstrate in an autonomous vehicle case study.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - A credit-based shaper (CBS) is adopted to guarantee the timing requirements of stream reservation (SR) class traffic in an Ethernet-audio video bridging (AVB) network, which introduces additional delay for best-effort (BE) traffic. This paper proposes an approach for calculating the worst-case response time (WCRT) of BE traffic and guaranteeing tightness; Moreover, a longest busy interval in which there exits an alternation of pending loads in SR class A and class B traffic at an output port, is defined and identified. Some suggestions for CBS parameters setting can be got form the results. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The IEEE 802.1Q-2018 standard embeds in Ethernet bridges novel features that are very important for automated driving, such as the support for time-driven communications. However, cars move in a world where unpredictable events may occur and determine unforeseen situations. To properly react to such situations, the in-car communication system has to support event-driven transmissions with very low and bounded delays. This work provides the performance evaluation of EDSched, a traffic management scheme for IEEE 802.1Q bridges and end nodes that introduces explicit support for event-driven real-time traffic. EDSched works at the MAC layer and builds upon the mechanisms defined in the IEEE 802.1Q-2018 standard. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Time sensitive networking (TSN) is an emerging technology for in-vehicle networks, which has strict timing constraints and dependability requirements. The performance and efficiency of TSN depend on a reliable scheduling mechanism for real-time communications. Traditionally, the TSN scheduler is analyzed using simulations and testing, which are error-prone and inaccurate. In this article, we employ a timed model checker UPPAAL to formally model and analyze the TSN scheduler with a consideration of its transmission latency and time utilization. We first use the build-in assertion in UPPAAL to verify the deadlock-free property, safety property, and starvation-free property of our model. Then, we calculate the time utilization and the transmission delay of audio video bridging data frame under two scheduling mechanisms according to the simulation process. Then, we compared the time performance of this two scheduling mechanisms and found that each of them has their own advantages and disadvantages. This article provides a formal analysis framework for investigating scheduling strategies in TSN, which facilitates the designers to have a better understanding and development of TSN schedulers in the future. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Driver assistance, self-driving, and multimedia systems have two common implications: increasing demand on network bandwidth and the need for more powerful computation nodes. As a result, intra-vehicular networks (IVNs) change their layout. They are built around central nodes connected to the rest of the vehicle via Ethernet. The usage of Ethernet presents a challenge, as it lacks support for deterministic behavior by design. The solution is found within the IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards, introducing real-time, low-latency, and deterministic communication into the Ethernet ecosystem. These new networked systems need to be thoroughly evaluated with IVN requirements in mind. To assess numerous configurations of IVN setups, in this work, we introduce a novel Environment for Generic In-vehicular Networking Experiments - EnGINE. It allows, among many others, repeatable, reproducible, and replicable TSN experiments with high precision and flexibility, which is not possible to run using proprietary solutions. EnGINE is based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and is orchestrated by a flexible Ansible framework. This approach allows us to configure various topologies emulating realistic IVNs behavior, which is challenging using simulations. Based on available related work, we further address the challenges found in the IVNs. We derive additional requirements for experiments in the TSN domain and present our approach to fulfill them in an experimental setting. We believe that EnGINE provides the ideal environment for TSN network experiments.  © 2021 IFIP.

AB  - Worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis is a prevalent way to ensure the timely execution of programs in time-critical systems. With the advent of new technologies such as fog computing and time-sensitive networking (TSN), the interest in timing analysis has increased in industrial communication. This paper highlights experiences made while adjusting the publisher of the open62541 OPC UA stack to enable WCET analysis, following a simple process combined with the open-source platform T-CREST. The main challenges are the required knowledge about the code and the specific communication software characteristics like variable message sizes. Other findings indicate the need for other types of annotation for indirect recursion or callback functions. The paper provides the foundation for further research on adjusting the implementation of existing industrial communication protocols for WCET analysis. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - IEEE802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) makes it conceivable to convey the data traffic of time as well as critical applications using Ethernet shared by different applications having diversified Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for both TSN and non-TSN. TSN assures a guaranteed data delivery with limited latency, low jitter, and amazingly low loss of data for time-critical traffic. By holding networking resources for basic traffic, and applying different queuing and traffic shaping strategies, TSN accomplishes zero congestion loss for basic time-critical traffic. In proposed system, backpropagation algorithm is used to train the training set and fuzzy inference system methodologies such as Mamdani fuzzy inference system which has fuzzy inputs and fuzzy outputs, Sugeno FIS which has fuzzy inputs and a crisp output and adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system has obtained from the neural network and fuzzy logic. The proposed system uses neuro-fuzzy techniques to handle frame pre-emption and reduces the time taken for decision making. It presents a decision making process using the traffic class. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Co.

AB  - The functionality advancements and novel customer features that are currently found in modern automotive systems require high-bandwidth and low-latency in-vehicle communications, which become even more compelling for autonomous vehicles. In a recent effort to meet these requirements, the IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group has developed a set of standards that introduce novel features in Switched Ethernet. TSN standards offer, for example, a common notion of time through accurate and reliable clock synchronization, delay bounds for real-time traffic, time-driven transmissions, improved reliability, and much more. In order to fully utilize the potential of these novel protocols in the automotive domain, TSN should be seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art and state-of-practice model-based development processes for automotive embedded systems. Some of the core phases in these processes include software architecture modeling, timing predictability verification, simulation, and hardware realization and deployment. Moreover, throughout the development of automotive embedded systems, the safety and security requirements specified on these systems need to be duly taken into account. In this context, this work provides an overview of TSN in automotive applications and discusses the recent technological developments relevant to the adoption of TSN in automotive embedded systems. The work also points at the open challenges and future research directions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Wireless control applications will play a fundamental role in future factory environments to enable novel mobility use cases and achieve the desired flexibility in production. The standardized integration of 5G into a time-sensitive networking (TSN) environment defines the joint architecture and communication interfaces between the different networks to support time-critical applications. Managing and scheduling such a network in an end-to-end fashion to guarantee the stringent QoS requirements is however a complex task. In this work, we present an efficient window-based resource allocation method for the end-to-end network. A big challenge in scheduling periodic and time-critical control applications over a wireless system is the uncertainty of the channel. We hence introduce a fading correlation-aware optimization to find robust schedules. Our simulation study shows that this approach is able to reduce peak resource demands and hence improve the schedulability compared to standard channel-unaware TSN scheduling. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - As an emerging communication tool, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is proposed by the IEEE 802.1 TSN Task Group to achieve deterministic data transmission. TSN defines protocols to ensure the determinism of traditional Ethernet by configuring gate control list (GCL). However, calculating schedules of GCL according to different time-sensitive applications, is not well-defined in the standard. In this paper, we focus on the problem of mixed time-sensitive data transmission. To this end, we first model the data into three categories: high time-sensitive (HTS) flows, low time-sensitive (LTS) flows, and best-effort flows. Then based on the models, we propose a coordinated transmission framework to transmit mixed time-sensitive data. Under this framework, we develop a parameter selection approach for choosing the proper cycle time and the scheduling unit. To reduce the impact of HTS data on LTS data flows, we formulate a fine-grained scheduling problem. Then, we design an injection time grouping (ITG) algorithm by grouping the flows with the same period to reduce the computation complexity. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the parameter selection approach and ITG algorithm. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, intelligence has become an inevitable trend in the development of automobile industry, and advanced assistant driving or autonomous driving are important features of automobile intelligence. The increasing level of self-driving puts forward higher demands for in-vehicle communication. And traditional in-vehicle networks are difficult to cover a series of complex deterministic communication requirements including high-bandwidth, low latency, low jitter and zero congestion. Therefore, Automotive Ethernet technology came into being. IEEE developed a series of Time Sensitive Networks (TSN) standard protocols based on traditional Ethernet. TSN added a series of key mechanisms that provide realtime and reliability guarantees for data transmission. In this paper, we reviewed the evolution of in-vehicle networks and outlined the development of Time Triggered Ethernet (TTE) and TSN researches in recent years. We also discussed the importance of deterministic researches on in-vehicle networks and the challenges in the development of the Internet of Things, E/E (Electrical/Electronic) architectures, intelligent driving, and new energy vehicles. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - IEC 61850 has become the reference standard for Substation Automation Systems (SAS) in smart power grids. Current IEC 61850 compliant SAS use Ethernet technology for both Event-Triggered (ET) and Time-Triggered (TT) traffic to transport highly critical messages requiring low-latency guarantees. However the real-time guarantee is often achieved by over-provisioning network resources. In this paper we study the potentials of using Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) in SAS. TSN adds real-time enhancement to the existing IEEE 802.1Q standard by providing several new traffic shapers. If TT traffic can be guaranteed by scheduling its transmission at the right time using TSN time-aware shaper, it is not the case for ET traffic. The paper contribution is twofold: proposing a first mapping of the IEC 61850 protocols to the TSN traffic classes, based on the analysis of both TSN and IEC 61850 protocols; and developing an exact worst-case delay (WCD) analysis for ET traffic. The tightness of the developed WCD analysis has be shown by simulations. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Deterministic and low end-to-end latency communication is an urgent demand for many safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles and automated industries. The time-sensitive network (TSN) is introduced as Ethernet-based amendments in IEEE 802.1 TSN standards to support time-triggered (TT) traffic in these applications. In the presence of TT flows, TSN is designed to integrate Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) and Best Effort (BE) traffic types. Although AVB traffic has a lower priority than TT, it still requires low and deterministic latency performance, which may not be guaranteed under strict predefined TT scheduling constraints. For this reason, a window-overlapping scheduling algorithm is recently proposed in different works as analytical forms for TT latency under overlapping-windows based. But worst-case AVB latency evaluation under overlapped TT windows is also essential for critical optimizations and tradeoffs. In this paper, a worst-case end-to-end delay (WCD) for AVB traffic under overlapping-based TT windows (AVB-OBTTW) algorithm is proposed. Separate analytical models are derived using the network calculus (NC) approach for AVB-OBTTW with both non-preemption and preemption mechanisms. Using an actual vehicular use case, the proposed models are evaluated with back-to-back and porosity configurations under light and heavy loading scenarios. For specific AVB credit bounds, a clear WCD reduction has been achieved by increasing the overlapping ratio (OR), especially under back-to-back configuration. Preemption and non-preemption modes are compared under different loading conditions, resulting in lower WCDs using preemption mode than non-preemption, especially with porosity style. Compared to the latest related works, AVB-OBTTW reduces WCD bounds and increases unscheduled bandwidth, leading to the highest enhancements with the maximum allowable OR.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Industrial automation is changing towards a flat and highly interconnected architecture, with requirements for end-to-end real-time enabled machine-to-machine communications. Technologies such as time-sensitive networking (TSN) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) publish-subscribe provide the necessary features. While TSN is well explored, OPC UA's execution time behavior remains unknown. This article presents findings made while extending the open62541 OPC UA Pub Sub stack with the 802.1q VLAN tag to enable IEEE 802.1Qbv time-aware scheduling. The results include end-to-end timing measures and worst-case execution time analyses considering various payloads. Time-predictable T-CREST platforms host the publisher and subscriber, and a TSN network handles message transmission. The paper concludes by outlining further research focusing on dynamic memory access, buffer management, and the inclusion of non-priority access to the Ethernet port.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - As vehicles get equipped with increasingly complex sensors and processors, the communication requirements become more demanding. Traditionally, vehicles have used specialized networking technologies designed to guarantee bounded latencies, such as the controller area network (CAN) bus. Recently, some have used dedicated technologies to transport signals from cameras, lidars, radars, and ultrasonic sensors.

AB  - Ultra-low latency (ULL) data transmission is essential for many network applications. The IEEE 802.1Qbv Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) is a typical mechanism for providing ULL data transmission in bridged networks. All TAS enabled nodes must be time-synchronized and their gate time schedule in the gate control list (GCL) must be pre-configured considering the data arrival time and the maximum burst size. Consequently, the bandwidth utilization is drastically deteriorated if the data size becomes small, because no data can be forwarded until the state of the gate changes. Although the underutilization of link bandwidth can be addressed with gate shrunk (GS-)TAS which enables runtime reconfiguration of the GCL using a GS-frame at the end of an express traffic. However, the states of gates cannot be appropriately controlled with the existing scheme if there are many express streams. To address this issue, this paper proposes a concept of multi-stream gate control for TAS. The proposed idea enables runtime reconfiguration of the GCL to avoid the reduction in bandwidth utilization irrespective of the burst size and the number of streams. The performance of the proposed scheme was confirmed with computer simulations. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Thanks to the standards being developed by IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group, the classical IEEE 802.1 Ethernet architecture is now enhanced to accommodate real-time and safety-critical requirements emerging in various cyber-physical systems. The deterministic nature of the communication is achieved through the time-triggered traffic, which requires introducing strict scheduling constraints that may be an obstacle in finding a feasible schedule. In this article, we propose a simple hardware enhancement of a switch along with a relaxed scheduling constraint that increases schedulability and throughput of the time-triggered traffic but maintains the deterministic nature and timeliness guarantees in a TSN network. We give a formal proof to justify the claims and an algorithm benchmarking and experimental validation to demonstrate the gains. The results show that the number of flows that can be scheduled in the model with the relaxed constraint is on average by 75.1 % larger than in the traditional model.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.

AB  - To achieve low latency transmission of time-sensitive flows in Ethernet networks, the IEEE introduced the IEEE 802.1Qbu Standard, which specifies a 1-level preemption scheme for IEEE 802.1 networks. The specification allows the suspension of a preemptable frame prior to its completion for the speedy transmission of an express frame; but any other preemptable frame cannot be transmitted before the completion of the already preempted frame. While this approach improves the performance of express frames, the performance is negatively impacted in scenarios where the number of express frames is high. Another limitation is the fact that preemptable frames with timing requirements can suffer long blocking periods due to the non-preemptive service of frames in the same category. This is irrespective of the individual priority level of each frame. Recently, a multi-level preemption scheme has been proposed to circumvent these limitations. The work focused on the feasibility and implementation requirement of such an approach, but a formal analysis of the worst-case performance guarantees under the proposed scheme was not provided. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting the aforementioned analysis of the TSN IEEE 802.1Qbu networks under the multi-level preemption assumption. Evaluation is performed with a realistic automotive use-case and the results showcase an improvement up to 53.07% for preemptable frames with firm timing requirements. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Time sensitive network is an extension of standard Ethernet network, which meets the delay and jitter requirements of critical traffic in specific fields through various mechanisms. The time sensitive network calculates the traffic schedule that meets the critical traffic requirements by planning the overall network traffic, which is NP-complete. When there is a new flow demand in the network, most of the existing solutions are to resolve the schedule table for all network traffic, which is time-comsuming. To provide a solution on such problem, we propose an incremental scheduling method for time-sensitive network so that the scheduling table corresponding to the new traffic in the network is therefore solved. The method adopts a combination of routing and scheduling, selecting alternative routing paths for traffic via heuristic methods, and then performs incremental scheduling on the gate control list of the devices selected by the routing to solve the feasible scheduling of new flows. The experiment results show that, compared with the traditional static scheduling scheme, the method can greatly speed up the process of scheduling and solving, and is able to solve the problem within seconds, meeting the needs of online incremental scheduling. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Many applications such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), tactile Internet, and 5G/6G mobile require Ultra-Low Latency (ULL) in data transmission. The end-to-end latency is required to be on the order of sub-millisecond in these applications. The IEEE 802.1 Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards have been developed to provide ULL networking. The IEEE 802.1Qbv Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), which is a typical flow control mechanism of TSN, is a traffic shaper to provide deterministic end-to-end ULL transmission for express traffic. The Gate Control List (GCL) of all TAS enabled nodes must be configured in a coordinated manner to ensure ULL. However, existing configuration schemes cannot be employed in highly dynamic conditions where the distribution of time-sensitive streams frequently changes. It will be a significant problem to deal with such dynamic conditions in the future. Therefore, this paper proposes a real-time adaptive gate scheduling scheme for TAS. The scheduling problem is formulated as a boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), and the employment of an FPGA-based solver is proposed to achieve runtime fast computation. The proposed scheme enables real-time reconfiguration for high flexibility and high bandwidth utilization to deal with the dynamics of network conditions. The feasibility of the proposed scheme is confirmed with computer simulations.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - TSN or Time-Sensitive Network is an aggregation of standards that can include the Ethernet extension to support the real-time application while preserving the safety-critical distribution with the hardware. To improve real-time guarantees establishes multiple shaping such as Credit-Based Shaping (CBS), Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS), Burst Limiting Shaping (BLS) and scheduling processes like Time Aware Shaping (TAS) and various traffic are incorporated. In industrial applications, CBS and TAS combination are widely used. Due to increase of number of traffic in modern industries, control data traffic (CDT), are frequently transfer of the system as a consequence AVB credit are freeze very often and behavior of credit of AVB and timing are continuous changing. Analyzing of the behavior of AVB credit for different timing conditions, it can be predicted total traffic condition of different flows and optimistic shaping mechanism of CBS can enhance quality of service. Several optimal cases have been studied.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Nowadays, most of cyber-physical systems in avionics, automotive or recent Industry 4.0 domains require networked communication for mixed-critical applications. Ethernet-based networks such as AFDX, TTEthernet or TSN are capable to support transmission of both safety-critical and non-critical flows. This paper focuses on the TTEthernet network compliant with the avionics ARINC 664-P7 standard supporting time-triggered communication (TT) together with rate-constrained (RC) and best-effort (BE) traffic. Due to a global synchronization, TT communication with low latency and minimal jitter is ensured with static schedules computed offline. For event-triggered RC flows, bounded jitter at the source and end-to-end latency are guaranteed with worst-case analysis methods. With the increasing demands of applications, flows with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements such as video or audio may be transmitted as BE flows. However, on current configurations, no guarantees are offered to BE flows. In this paper, we aim at increasing the maximum RC utilization and improving the QoS of BE flows to allow the transmission of video or audio traffic with low jitter and end-to-end delay requirements. For this, we focus on the scheduling mechanisms and propose a scheduling approach based on a static slotted table that is applied at end systems. This table integrates the TT schedules usually obtained with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) approaches and establishes offsets of RC flows that reduce the end-to-end delay of BE flows. Several strategies for offset computations are proposed based on the distribution of flows locally at end system or globally at switch. We show that local strategies perform better than the global ones to reduce end-to-end delay of BE flows. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The deterministic behavior of real-time communication networks is achieved by time-triggered periodic schedules for critical data traffic. Calculating such a schedule requires satisfying a lot of constraints, which in practice may be difficult due to the increasing number of data flows in the network. In the current approaches, the routes of flows are usually given or determined separately from the scheduling process. If the routes of flows can be computed jointly with scheduling, more flows could be scheduled since the algorithm chooses among alternative paths. This paper formalizes the problem of joint routing and scheduling of time-triggered periodic communication in Time-Sensitive Networks, guaranteeing the required deterministic nature of the communication, and proposes two models in Constraint Programming formalism. We further apply the Logic-Based Benders Decomposition on the proposed models and give an extensive experimental evaluation of our solutions showing that our novel approach that models waiting of frames in queues along with the Logic-Based Benders Decomposition exhibits the best performance and significantly increases the schedulability over the state-of-the-art methods. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - EtherCAT is a real-time industrial Ethernet technology suitable for hard and soft real-time requirements. It is based on new technology, 'on-the-fly processing', which significantly reduces cycle times and jitter to further expand the capabilities of IIoT. IEEE 802.1 TSN in recent years gained more attention in IIoT because it offers real-time communication over a shared Ethernet medium with predictable end-to-end delay and jitter. However, there is no work presented to showcase the benefits of EtherCAT and TSN integration apart from theoretical information. Therefore, to expedite the analysis of EtherCAT over a TSN network, we used OMNeT++. Here, we will compare the cycle time and jitter by evaluating different scenarios of EtherCAT communications over a NeSTiNg TSN network. © 2021 IFIP.

AB  - This paper presents a schedulability analysis for the Best-Effort (BE) traffic class within Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) networks. The presented analysis considers several features in the TSN standards, including the Credit-Based Shaper (CBS), the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) and the frame preemption. Although the BE class in TSN is primarily used for the traffic with no strict timing requirements, some industrial applications prefer to utilize this class for the non-hard real-time traffic instead of classes that use the CBS. The reason mainly lies in the fact that the complexity of TSN configuration becomes significantly high when the time-triggered traffic via the TAS and other classes via the CBS are used altogether. We demonstrate the applicability of the presented analysis on a vehicular application use case. We show that a network designer can get information on the schedulability of the BE traffic, based on which the network configuration can be further refined with respect to the application requirements. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - With the development of Industry 4.0, optical networks are playing a key role in carrying large amounts of data traffic in industrial networks. Multicluster time-sensitive passive optical local area networks (POLs) use passive optical networks (PONs), which are important optical network segments, as local area networks (LANs); such networks can provide high-capacity real-time communications for large-scale industrial systems and have the potential to replace legacy LANs in industrial networks. To satisfy dynamic application requirements, POLs for future industrial networks need to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to frequent changes. Hence, this paper proposes a heuristic fragmentation-aware scheduling (FAS) method based on fast list scheduling for the scheduling of real-time traffic in multicluster time-sensitive POLs. The FAS algorithm selects a scheduling plan in accordance with a fragmentation calculation, schedules one time-triggered (TT) flow at a time from the pending scheduled TT flow set, and incrementally updates the scheduling table. The list processing mechanism of list scheduling is modified to improve scheduling performance, while the fast speed of list scheduling is inherited. Simulation results show that compared with a basic rate monotonic scheduling (RMS) list scheduler, FAS significantly increases the schedulable scale and schedulable load of the TT flow set while markedly reducing the TT communication overhead. With the help of FAS, multicluster time-sensitive POLs can support more critical tasks with higher network efficiency, allowing them to better cope with future dynamic and complex industrial application scenarios. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper identifies a limitation in the frame preemption model in the TSN standard (IEEE 802.1Q-2018), due to which high priority frames can experience significantly long blocking delays, thereby exacerbating their worst-case response times. This limitation can have a considerable impact on the design, analysis and performance of TSN-based systems. To address this limitation, the paper presents a novel and more efficient frame preemption model in the TSN standard that allows over 90% reduction in the maximum blocking delay leading to lower worst-case response times of high priority frames compared to the frame preemption model used in the existing works. The paper also shows that the improvement becomes even more significant in multi-switch TSN networks. In order to evaluate the effects of preemption, the paper performs simulations by enabling and disabling preemptions as well as enabling and disabling the Hold/Release mechanism supported by TSN. Furthermore, the paper performs a comparative evaluation of the two models of frame preemption in TSN using simulations. The evaluation shows that the maximum response times of high priority frames can be significantly reduced with very small impact on the response times of lower priority frames. The paper also shows the improvement in the maximum response times of higher priority frames using an automotive industrial use case that employs a multi-hop TSN network for on-board communication. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - A short time after the official launch of WiFi 6, IEEE 802.11 working groups along with the WiFi Alliance are already designing its successor in the wireless local area network (WLAN) ecosystem: WiFi 7. With the IEEE 802.11be amendment as one of its main constituent parts, future WiFi 7 aims to include time-sensitive networking (TSN) capabilities to support low latency and ultra-reliability in license-exempt spectrum bands, enabling many new Internet of Things scenarios. This article first introduces the key features of IEEE 802.11be, which are then used as the basis to discuss how TSN functionalities could be implemented in WiFi 7. Finally, the benefits and requirements of the most representative Internet of Things low-latency use cases for WiFi 7 are reviewed: multimedia, healthcare, industrial, and transport. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - To make manufacturers more intelligent in the production of cyber-physical systems (CPS), the IEEE 802.1 working group proposes a Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) standard based on traditional Ethernet. TSN can help the industrial environment to realize intelligent real-time transmission requirements. At present, the research on TSN focuses mainly on how to optimize the scheduling table synthesis to reduce the end-to-end delay of the frame. Routing selection typically uses the common shortest path first (SPF) and weighted shortest path first (wtSPF) algorithms. The path chosen by these algorithms can only ensure a low end-to-end delay of newly added streams, but they cannot guarantee the success rate of scheduling newly added streams or determine whether the delay will have a serious impact on other streams. Therefore, this paper proposes a scheduling routing algorithm for the TSN environment, named Real-Time Routing Scheduler (RTRS), which is applicable to Time-Triggered (TT) streams with immediate constraints. Based on the calculation of the end-to-end maximum delay time, the RTRS is used as a basis for routing to ensure that all TT streams are transmitted within the deadline. The experimental results show that the RTRS algorithm can provide an excellent real-time performance of CPS, improve the scheduling success rate, optimize the maximum end-to-end delay, and ensure that newly added streams do not easily affect the transmission of other streams. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards' amendment 802.1Qbv provides real-time guarantees for Scheduled Traffic (ST) streams by the Time Aware Shaper (TAS) mechanism. In this paper, we develop offline schedule optimization objective functions to configure the TAS for ST streams, which can be effective to achieve a high Quality of Service (QoS) of lower priority Best-Effort (BE) traffic. This becomes useful if real-time streams from legacy protocols are configured to be carried by the BE class or if the BE class is used for value-added (but non-critical) services. We present three alternative objective functions, namely Maximization, Sparse and Evenly Sparse, followed by a set of constraints on ST streams. Based on simulated stream traces in OMNeT++/INET TSN NeSTiNg simulator, we compare our proposed schemes with a most commonly applied objective function in terms of overall maximum end-to-end delay and deadline misses of BE streams. The results confirm that changing the schedule synthesis objective to our proposed schemes ensures timely delivery and lower end-to-end delays in BE streams. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - When a Time-Sensitive Network, comes to networking, TSN is an assemblage of standards that may incorporate the Ethernet extension to enable real-time applications while maintaining the safety-critical distribution with the hardware and software. Multiple shaping processes, such as Credit-Based Shaping (CBS), Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS), Burst Limiting Shaping (BLS), and scheduling procedures, such as Time Aware Shaping (TAS), are used to enhance real-time guarantees. Different traffic types are also included in the shaping mechanism. It is very common to see the combination of CBS and TAS in industrial applications. CBS and TAS combination shaping adopt gate control list (GCL), which have periodic scheduling gate. However, due to the increased number of traffic, the frequency overlaps with different traffic gates, and for this reason, congestion of data in different traffic gates happens quite often. This paper proposes a theoretical approach that does not include overlapping gates; therefore, the service in the data traffic can be improved significantly. Integer Linear Programming has been used for producing proper scheduling procedures. Our proposed model contains a network calculus-based approach that can calculate the formal service curve of Time-Triggered (TT) and Audio Video Bridge (AVB) for Non-overlapping Gate. For further verification, MATLAB RTC has been utilized for several case studies. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - For many Ethernet-based real-time systems, such as those from automotive, avionics, and industry automation domains, fault tolerance is emerged as an essential requirement for enabling fail-safe or fail-operational behavior. Consequently, the IEEE 802.1CB-2017 standard was published. It is currently the only available time-sensitive networking group standard offering protection against transmission errors. It tackles these faults by preventively replicating the frames and transmitting redundant copies via different paths to the destination. However, in contrast to its obvious advantages, the standard contains some pitfalls: most notably, it lacks protection mechanisms against inadequate configurations, which can not only invalidate the intended increase in reliability but even actively jeopardize the safety of the network. Due to the lack of alternative mechanisms, it is crucial to fully understand the fundamental properties of the standard and its implications on the safety aspects of the network traffic. In this letter, we identify critical aspects and limitations of the standard. We demonstrate the risks of inadequate configurations, discuss their ramifications. Finally, we provide an intuition and initial steps toward deriving the formal worst-case timing analysis of the standard, which is a key requirement for its safe and efficient implementation in the aforementioned real-time domains. © 2009-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Fifth Generation (5G) is expected to meet stringent performance network requisites of the Industry 4.0. Moreover, its built-in network slicing capabilities allow for the support of the traffic heterogeneity in Industry 4.0 over the same physical network infrastructure. However, 5G network slicing capabilities might not be enough in terms of degree of isolation for many private 5G networks use cases, such as multi-tenancy in Industry 4.0. In this vein, infrastructure network slicing, which refers to the use of dedicated and well isolated resources for each network slice at every network domain, fits the necessities of those use cases. In this article, we evaluate the effectiveness of infrastructure slicing to provide isolation among production lines (PLs) in an industrial private 5G network. To that end, we develop a queuing theory-based model to estimate the end-to-end (E2E) mean packet delay of the infrastructure slices. Then, we use this model to compare the E2E mean delay for two configurations, i.e., dedicated infrastructure slices with segregated resources for each PL against the use of a single shared infrastructure slice to serve the performance-sensitive traffic from PLs. Also we evaluate the use of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) against bare Ethernet to provide layer 2 connectivity among the 5G system components. We use a complete and realistic setup based on experimental and simulation data of the scenario considered. Our results support the effectiveness of infrastructure slicing to provide isolation in performance among the different slices. Then, using dedicated slices with segregated resources for each PL might reduce the number of the production downtimes and associated costs as the malfunctioning of a PL will not affect the network performance perceived by the performance-sensitive traffic from other PLs. Last, our results show that, besides the improvement in performance, TSN technology truly provides full isolation in the transport network compared to standard Ethernet thanks to traffic prioritization, traffic regulation, and bandwidth reservation capabilities. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) applications have diverse network session requirements. Certain critical applications, such as emergency alert relay, industrial floor evacuation, and surveillance systems, require fresh updates that can maintain the most recently delivered packets. This requires high reconfigurability to an extent where the system can measure the impact of an event and adapt the network accordingly. Several approaches have been proposed that provide high precision transmission and bounded latencies. One prominent solution strategy in the literature is based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) control to resolve latency-related issues, such as congestion, for factory floor transmissions. The OpenFlow protocol is a key interface used in SDN to create a low-latency environment. However, the existing approaches provide only offline solutions that are typically compute intensive. Therefore, this article proposes an algorithm based on simple online strategies that utilize an SDN controller with a global view of the network. More specifically, within the context of the IEEE Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards this article: (1) designs a control policy framework called TSNu that guarantees transmission time-slot allocations for Scheduled Traffic while mitigating network congestion, (2) develops a utility maximization approach to jointly optimize scheduling, routing, and admission control while ensuring network stability and maximizing the flow admission to the network, and (3) presents extensive theoretical analysis and simulation to evaluate the proposed TSNu design. The conducted evaluations indicate substantially improved performance compared with state-of-the-art policies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The growing popularity of intelligent manufacturing is driven by deterministic transmission demands of applications in industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS). However, the ossified shortages of industrial wireless communication such as diverse quality of service (QoS) and complex signaling processes incur a severe long tail of transmission delay distribution. As a solution, the 5th generation (5G) wireless communication technology provides ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) for industry scenarios. Moreover, the newly proposed time-sensitive networking (TSN) standards guarantee the transmission determinacy by gate mechanism. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous time-sensitive network (HTSN) co-designed by 5G and TSN. We first develop a predictive multi-priority wireless scheduling mechanism based on semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) to reduce signaling delay by reserving resources in advance. Then we propose an adaptive data injection mechanism for TSN based on per-stream filtering and policing (PSFP), which dynamically adjusts the priority of data for queue injection in TSN. To further reduce the long tail of delay, we employ a risk-sensitive learning method to improve the worst-case delay. Simulations on a hot rolling production scenario demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms under HTSN achieve great performance in terms of integrated delay and resource utilization. © 2021, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Industrial automation is changing towards higher integration and seamless communication. A stepping stone is end-to-end real-time machine-to-machine communication, now becoming feasible with technologies such as time-sensitive networking (TSN) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) publish-subscribe. While TSN takes care of communication, the OPC UA stack's execution time behavior remains unknown. This paper highlights experiences made while adjusting the OPC UA subscriber of the open62541 stack for worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis. Two directly connected time-predictable T-CREST platforms hosting the publisher and subscriber delivered end-to-end timing measures validating the WCET estimates. The paper concludes by outlining further research with several time-predictable publishers and subscribers. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - With the continuous development of industry, information and intelligence have gradually become the keywords of industrial control. In modern industrial scenarios, more and more devices are connected to the factory network, and the complex network environment will greatly affect the end-to-end transmission performance of key control flows, which brings a huge impact to those high-precision control signal transmissions. With the development of Time Sensitive Network (TSN) in recent years, more and more people have introduced this technology to the field of industrial control. In this paper, we propose a scheduling scheme based on constraint strategy for the key technology of TSN - Time Aware Shaper (TAS). This scheme can derive the appropriate network constraint strategy and optimization scheme of network resource utilization according to the end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) of multiple key data streams in the network, and finally obtain the configuration scheme of Gate Control Lists (GCLs). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Time Sensitive Network (TSN) is a high-quality realtime transmission network with bounded transmission delay, low transmission jitter and extremely low data loss rate. This paper studies the application-level scheduling problem of time-triggered traffic in time-sensitive networks. Firstly, we define a network systematization model, which communicates through time-triggered traffic classes, and treats tasks and network communication as the same scheduling problem, and search the whole solution space. Secondly, the design goal is set to minimize the total delay of all applications, use the defined model to construct logical constraints, and correctly describe the combination of network and task scheduling. At the same time, unnecessary constraints are reduced and the scheduling model is simplified. Finally, a comprehensive method of distributed system application layer scheduling using time-triggered traffic in Ethernet communication is proposed. Different optimization goals are considered in the method, and the work is focused on application-level optimization. The experimental evaluation uses various comprehensive network topologies and system configurations, which show that the comprehensive scheduling method can effectively solve the scheduling problem and meet the requirements of time-critical tasks.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The IEEE 802.1 TSN working group published a set of standards which adds new functionalities to switched Ethernet networks. These new functionalities notably aim at making the design of deterministic Ethernet networks possible, enabling their use for real-time applications. This determinism comes however at the cost of a greatly increased complexity in configuration effort, especially for largescale networks. In addition, this new complexity also affects the network simulation tools that are commonly used when designing such networks. As most of the existing ones only partially support new TSN functionalities, one has often to combine several simulators for achieving a reliable TSN network design. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach which aims at assisting the design of TSN networks. Modeling allows the creation of a formal representation of the network which can then be used to automatically generate configurations. This approach has been successfully implemented as a TSN configuration software called MoBACT, that enables the use of multiple simulation/emulation tools during the design phase by generating configurations for different targets for easing crosscheck of simulation results. Since each generated configuration is derived from the same representation of the network, our approach guarantees the consistency of the different configurations generated for each tool.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - ARINC 664, which is a heavily used protocol for modern avionics networks, is preferred due to its simplicity although its mixed-criticality support is limited. Time Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet), and IEEE Time Sensitive Networking (TSN), which utilize time synchronized schedule, are more suitable for supporting mixed-criticality applications; however, both require a fault tolerant time synchronization that makes the certification process more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic priority assignment (DPA) concept together with the burst limiting shaper (BLS) from the IEEE TSN standard to enhance the schedulability and the mixed-criticality support of ARINC 664. The decision of flow re-assignment to a new priority class is done by calculating the high priority (HP) and low priority (LP) class worst-case delays using the network calculus framework. The numerical results show that the class utilization rates can be significantly increased by using the DPA concept with and without the BLS while the deadline constraints for all classes are satisfied. Thus, the DPA can improve the schedulability and mixed-criticality of ARINC 664 without using any time synchronization mechanism. © 2021 IFIP.

AB  - In the last decade, Ethernet networks that require real time constraints are massively increased. Switched Ethernet is reshaping in-vehicle communications. To meet real-time requirements for diverse data types in automotive communications, Quality-of-Service protocols that go beyond the mere use of priorities are required. In Vehicle networks requirements are evolving and need better Quality-of-Service (QoS) options. This applies also for industrial networks implementation. Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) IEEE 802.1 Task working group are providing wide variety of Standard. This standard widens the design space for car networks so lots of ideas exists now. We try in this paper to the best of our knowledge, give insights about the studies that were developed for mainly for car networks as well as open issues that are still needs further research. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Industrial communication networks, till date, have often relied on proprietary solutions for handling real-time control applications. These solutions are usually not interoperable with each other and are furthermore highly engineered to transport time-sensitive process control data making it rather difficult to deploy them in IT networks for enterprise applications. Future industrial use cases, however, demand a converged network. In this chapter, we analyze a selection of Industry 4.0 use cases currently under discussion with standards organizations like the IEC/IEEE, the 3GPP, etc. to derive the requirements for such a converged network. Furthermore, we provide a brief overview of the networking technologies being standardized "Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and its wireless counterpart TSN over 5G" to conceive such a converged network. Overall, we seek to discuss essential requirements and constraints that need to be taken into account for effective deployment of these technologies in practice. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Application of Ethernet-based networks in the autonomous and automated vehicles requires safe and efficient resource management policy. The network components must not only handle high volume of sensor data but also safely accommodate dynamics in system behavior, e.g. detect permanent failures, switch between different driving modes (city/highway), incorporate car-2-x communication etc. This is currently manageable only by using static network configuration, due to the safety concerns, leading to resource overprovisioning under almost all conditions or unfulfilled design requirements. In this work we present an alternative solution which, through protocol-based synchronization and fine-grained re-configuration, allows traffic isolation, fault recovery and controlled adjustments of network performance. This enables cost saving, multi-mode network functionality at low overhead as well as new system functions and improved user experience by dynamic over-the-air network operation. We offer a detailed evaluation of our approach in a demonstrator setup as well as a simulation and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - TSN, or Time-Sensitive Network, is a set of standards that allows an Ethernet network to be extended to serve real-time applications while ensuring safety-critical hardware delivery. TSN uses a variety of shaping and scheduling techniques, like Credit-Based Shaping, Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS), Burst-Limiting Shaper (BLS), and Time Aware Shaper (TAS), to improve real-time guarantees. In modern industries, the increasing number of traffic and data are causing the latency to increase significantly. To minimize the end-to-end delay, it is highly required to have lossless compress data. This paper proposes some pre-existing lossless compression algorithms (Huffman, L Z W, R L E), which are well suited for the TSN network It can improve the end-to-end delay despite increasing data and is applicable for the worst-case scenarios. So, the focus of this research is confined to CBS and CBS+TAS shaping mechanism. For the validation of our statement, we have simulated various traffics such as Control Data Traffic (CDT), Audio & Video Bridging (AVB) class A, AVB class B and best-effort by OMNeT++. Comparisons are shown in terms of end-to-end delay between the compressed and uncompressed data and end-to-end delay have been improved for all classes. © 2021 IEEE

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has presented extremely harsh requirements on deterministic transmission capability within different communication networks. However, most existing solutions mainly focus on one specific homogeneous scenario, such as pure IP routers or classical medium access control bridges, which leads to many tough challenges in flexibility and scalability. In this article, we propose a framework for heterogeneous deterministic networks (HDNs) to offer low latency and high reliability in tackling epidemics based on smart collaborative theory. Various wired and wireless connecting patterns are supported by utilizing a hybrid mode for COVID-19 relevant operations. Components generated from deterministic networking, time-sensitive networks, and 5G systems have been integrated to achieve corresponding features. The pervasive function translators are available according to virtualization technologies. The protocol-independent and segment-based concepts have been well considered and successfully implemented during our design process. The validations executed on top of the prototype and simulation platform illustrate the advantages of HDN. We aim to enable HDN as an evolutional structure for information exchange in eHealth and other vertical industries.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The broadening range of applications for vehicles has motivated the evolution of the automotive communication network. Ethernet has been deployed in production vehicles to build in-vehicle networks (IVN) by main manufacturers. To extent Ethernet with real-time service for future E/E architecture, a time-sensitive networking (TSN) profile for automotive Ethernet has been created. This paper evaluates the implementation of multiple traffic scheduling and shaping mechanisms in the automotive Ethernet, respectively. And we especially focus on two solutions, namely the time-aware shaping (TAS) and asynchronous traffic shaping (ATS). To investigate the performance, we introduce a TSN-based automotive gateway testing model in a simulation environment. Furthermore, another two methods, i.e., strict-priority and credit-based shaper (CBS), as well as TAS and ATS are implemented in the model and tested within a domain-based IVN scenario. The results show that TAS guarantees the shortest worst-case latency of high-priority streams, whereas it has a longer transmission latency for low-priority streams. ATS provides less determinism for high-priority streams than TAS, but ensures a better average latency of all streams. © 2021 KICS.

AB  - The IEEE 802.1Qcr Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) proposed by Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) is a flow control mechanism based on Urgency-based Scheduler (UBS). The ATS aims to reshape flows or traffic per-hop and is still with the update of the draft.In the draft of version 2.0, the ATS algorithm concerns about two parameters cir (Committed Information Rate) and cbs (Committed Burst Size). When an ATS shaper operates in the condition of parameter consistency, i.e. the cir and the cbs have the same values of the ingress flow's rate and burstiness respectively, the burst cascade can be avoided perfectly.On the contrary, we introduced a deterministic Network Calculus (NC) based method to compute the delay bound for an ATS hop with parameter inconsistency, with a concatenation model of this ATS shaper and its upstream Strict Priority Queuing (SPQ) scheduler. Furthermore, we induced a threshold for the cbs parameter corresponding to a certain ingress busrtiness. When the cbs of ATS is not equal to the threshold value, the delay bound of the flows shaped by the shaper will increase. In addition, the results of analysis and case study show that when the cbs of the ATS is changed, the delay bounds of other multiplexing flows will also be affected.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Von Willebrand disease (VWD) and platelet function disorders (PFDs) are congenital bleeding disorders caused by primary hemostasis defects. Platelet function tests are time-consuming and require considerable amounts of blood sample, and there have been no easy-to-use assays for assessing platelet function quickly and sensitively. We report the usefulness of a microchip flow-chamber system (T-TAS®) for detecting and/or predicting clinical severity in patients with VWD type 1 and type 2N and platelet storage pool disease. Here, we developed an application of a screening assay for primary hemostasis disorders. Methods: Microchips coated with collagen (PL-chip) and collagen/thromboplastin (AR-chip) were utilized to evaluate platelet thrombus formation (PTF) at high shear and fibrin-rich PTF at low shear, respectively, in whole blood samples from 22 patients with VWD (16 type 2A, four type 2B, two type 3) and four patients with PFDs (two BSS, two Glanzmann thrombasthenia). The time-to-increase by 10 kPa (T10) was calculated from flow pressure curves. Also, whole blood-induced platelet aggregation was assessed using Multiplate® analysis. Results: PL-chip T10 values ≥10 min successfully distinguished patients with all types of VWD and PFDs from healthy controls, irrespective of age, bleeding scores, and von Willebrand factor levels. However, AR-chip assay incompletely distinguished between type 2A patients and healthy ones. Multiplate analysis permitted screening of PFDs and type 3 VWD, but values in type 2A partially overlapped with those in controls. PL-chip assay did not reflect the clinical severity in these patients. Conclusions: T-TAS with PL-chip could be a quick screening tool for congenital primary hemostasis disorder, VWD, and PFDs. © 2020 Japan Pediatric Society

AB  - While the industry is continuously evolving towards more flexible and modular manufacturing environments, simultaneously requirements on the industrial network infrastructure are changing. Network convergence, flexibility in configuration with support of hard real-time end-to-end guarantees are playing a key role. A technology supporting these features is Time-sensitive Networking (TSN). The extension with TSN-over-5G to additionally support mobile use cases brings us one step closer towards a unified and converged wireless and wired network architecture, as needed for future manufacturing environments. At the same time, management and configuration of such large converged networks to guarantee real-time capabilities becomes inherently complex. In this work, we present a joint configuration approach that enables end-to-end scheduling optimization over a bridged network consisting of TSN and logical 5G bridges. We derive suitable network constraints and optimization strategies and apply constraint programming to determine feasible scheduling solutions. By providing numerical results from a simulative study, we show the effectiveness of our proposed end-to-end framework in terms of resource efficiency and support of concurrent users in the network. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a new set of amendments that guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of time-critical and safety-critical Ethernet applications. The guard band mechanism prevents time-sensitive traffic from colliding with non-time-sensitive traffic, causing potential bandwidth waste. Moreover, most of the existing scheduling strategies only consider Audio Video Bridging (AVB) traffic and Time-Triggered (TT) traffic, resulting in Best Effort (BE) traffic not being scheduled de facto. This article proposes a new system design and scheduling strategy for TSN switches. The size-aware group weighted round robin (SGWRR) strategy is proposed to schedule AVB queues according to subperiods, reducing the average scheduling intervals of the AVB frames. The entire scheduling cycle is divided into a protected slot and an unprotected slot, and dynamic programming is used to minimize guard band waste. An old queue priority (OQP) strategy is also proposed to provide scheduling opportunities for BE queues. A simulation of OMNet++ shows that SGWRR can achieve low average scheduling intervals while improving bandwidth utilization by 5.66% and that OQP can enhance BE scheduling opportunities by 21.9% under our experimental conditions compared with existing methods.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN) provide a universal real-time system solution, which guarantees end-to-end transmission with bounded low latency for time-triggered flows by the existing mechanisms. While there are also event-triggered flows i.e. burst or sporadic traffic in some systems such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), aircraft, and industrial automation, which limits the wider application of TSN. The existing centralized algorithms based on Time-aware Shaper (TAS) cannot deal with the mixture of time-triggered and event-triggered flows effectively because of the unpredictability of events, nor can asynchronous scheduling because of heavy traffic loads. In this paper, we present Mixed Flow Scheduling (MFS), an extended shaping mechanism to tolerate event-triggered flows in the periodic scheduling, which improves the link utilization by reusing the reserved bandwidth, meanwhile the performance of time-triggered flows is not negatively affected. In MFS, a virtual period is designed for event-triggered flows to calculate the reserved bandwidth by the scheduler and the reversed bandwidth is reused according to the multiplexing strategy. To evaluate the performance of MFS, we experimented with it on various numbers of time- and event-triggered flows and compared it with two schemes based on TAS. The results prove the effectiveness of MFS. With MFS, the schedulability of event-triggered flows is improved by 25%, the transmission delay is decreased by 45% and the bandwidth utilization is improved by more than 13% compared to the two other TAS schemes. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - There are quite tight timing requirements in deterministic low latency network. The IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group has proposed several traffic shapers to satisfy real-time communications requirements. Traditionally, the performance of TSN is analyzed by simulations, whereas these methods cannot cover all corner cases. This paper firstly presented formal models of the TSN's time-aware and peristaltic shapers using UPPAAL, tactically solving the problem mentioned above. Afterward, we verified some properties of the shapers models, of which the results could evaluate whether these shapers are able to satisfy strict timing requirements or not. Based on the models, we can discuss about the performance of time-critical traffic combining the preemption mechanism. More-over, we can also analyze resource utilization and transmission latency. Under the time properties analysis and verification of TSN traffic shapers, we can provide engineers with an accessible reference that may assist them in developing the TSN.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Machine learning has been recently applied in real-time systems to predict whether Ethernet network configurations are feasible in terms of meeting deadline constraints without executing conventional schedulability analysis. However, the existing prediction techniques require domain expertise to choose the relevant input features and do not perform consistently when topologies or traffic patterns differ significantly from the ones in the training data. To overcome these problems, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) prediction model that synthesizes relevant features directly from the raw data. This deep learning model possesses the ability to exploit relations among flows, links, and queues in switched Ethernet networks and generalizes to unseen topologies and traffic patterns. We also explore the use of ensembles of GNNs and show that it enhances the robustness of the predictions. An evaluation on heterogeneous testing sets comprising realistic automotive networks shows that ensembles of 32 GNN models feature a prediction accuracy ranging from 79.3% to 90% for Ethernet networks using priorities as the Quality-of-Service mechanism. The use of ensemble models provides a speedup factor ranging from 77 to 1,715 compared to schedulability analysis, which allows a far more extensive design space exploration.  © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - This paper presents the latest Ethernet standardization of in-vehicle network and the future trends of automotive Ethernet technology. The proposed system provides design and optimization algorithms for automotive networking technology related to AVB (Audio Video Bridge) technology. We present a design of in-vehicle network system as well as the optimization of AVB for automotive. A proposal of Reduced Latency of Machine to Machine (RLMM) plays an outstanding role in reducing the latency among devices. RLMM's approach to real-world experimental cases indicates a reduction in latency of around 41.2%. The setup optimized for the automotive network environment is expected to significantly reduce the time in the development and design process. The results obtained in the study of image transmission latency are trustworthy because average values were collected over a long period of time. It is necessary to analyze a latency between multimedia devices within limited time which will be of considerable benefit to the industry. Furthermore, the proposed reliable camera and video streaming through optimized AVB device settings would provide a high level of support in the real-time comprehension and analysis of images with AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithms in autonomous driving. © 2021 KSII

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is appealing to Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) due to its support for deterministic real-time communication based on Ethernet. The deterministic transmission of time-sensitive traffic is achieved through a time-triggered mechanism, which requires precise schedule synthesis. However, existing approaches mostly focus on the static schedule, which cannot guarantee rapid response to dynamic requirements due to long runtime. Moreover, the multicast scheduling problem required for distributed applications in IIoT has been ignored. In this paper, we formulate the joint routing and scheduling problem for multicast time-sensitive traffic based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and extend it to cluster-ILP (CILP) to accelerate schedule synthesis. Firstly, an improved topology pruning is introduced to reduce the scale of the scheduling problem. Then flows are divided into several groups and schedules are calculated for flows in different groups incrementally. The evaluation results indicate that our proposed algorithm can reduce the runtime by 86.7% on average while ensuring the performance of resource utilization, thus increasing the schedulability for dynamic applications in TSN. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Phase Change Memory (PCM) has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional DRAM memories especially in real-time embedded systems, due to their higher density and lower leakage power dissipation. However, PCM comes with its own drawbacks. Although, the performances of DRAM and PCM are comparable for memory reads, PCM is about three times slower in terms of write latency, and suffers from significantly lower write endurance. The high write latency of PCM may be detrimental to delivered QoS and may lead to deadline misses in real-time systems. To circumvent the problem, this paper proposes a novel memory scheduling scheme which employs separate write request buffer in order to prioritize reads over writes. The read requests are scheduled using an urgency based scheduler where urgency depends on allowable response times of tasks. The write requests are serviced when there are no pending reads using a similar urgency based scheduler as used for read requests. Experimental evaluation using standard benchmarks reveal that the proposed scheme is able to achieve better normalized QoS compared to existing scheduling techniques for PCM and comparable access latencies with respect to DRAM. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) on Ethernet is a promising communication technology in the automotive and industrial automation industries due to its real-time and high-bandwidth communication capabilities. Time-triggered scheduling and static routing are often adopted in these areas due to high requirements on predictability for safety-critical applications. Deadline-constrained routing and scheduling in TSN have been studied extensively in past research. However, scheduling and routing with reliability requirements in the context of transient faults are not yet studied. In this work, we propose an Satisfiability Modulo Theory-based technique to perform scheduling and routing that takes both reliability constraints and end-to-end deadline constraints into consideration. Heuristics have been applied to improve the scalability of the solution. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed technique.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Aiming at the coexistence of periodic packets and discrete packets in the Industrial Internet of Things(IIoT), and the low latency and high reliability requirements of industrial applications, this paper proposes a new algorithm called Time-sensitive Network Resource Scheduling Algorithm in IP Protocol (TSIPA) based on the theory of hybrid systems. TSIPA algorithm is also one of the feasible solutions to the problem of heterogeneous network integration in the Industrial Internet of Things. The packet priority, transmission time and maximum transmission delay of a single packet are considered in the TSIPA algorithm. Simulation experiments verified that the TSIPA algorithm satisfies the transmission requirements of packets with high packet priority, while basically controlling the average transmitted time of the queue to be sent within the required range, and reducing the packet loss rate. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an upcoming set of Ethernet standards designed for real-time and safety-critical Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications in automotive, aerospace, and industrial automation domains. With the combination, complexity, and flexibility of flow control mechanisms in TSN connected systems, the performance analysis for mixed-critical messages is becoming a difficult challenge. The flexible window-based gate control list (GCL) scheduling model has been proposed as a relaxation to assumptions on frames-to-window allocation, mutually exclusive gates opening, and scheduled end systems and switches, which offers more flexibility in the configuration of GCLs. In this article, we are interested in providing a reliable verification method based on the network calculus theory to drive GCL configurations for TSN networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first performance analysis method suitable for the general flexible window-based GCLs in entire TSN networks, by reflecting the relative positional relationships of windows for same priority queues on consecutive nodes and constructing the window limitations into the shaper curve, in order to reduce the pessimism of the latency bounds. We validate the proposed method through Industrial IoT synthetics test cases and two large realistic cases, showing the significant reduction in pessimism on delay bounds, and the correctness and scalability by comparing with results from the previous work and simulation results. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The spacecraft industry is facing a new challenge: new missions and customers require always more on-board performance. The current satellite network technologies will not be able to handle this increasing demand for long which leads the spacecraft industry to consider an upgrade of their satellite on-board networks. One opportunity has appeared through the use of Ethernet technologies to benefit from COTS components of a mass market. In this paper we discuss the suitability of several Ethernet technologies/standards with respect to the requirements of a satellite network in a qualitative approach. We will compare Ethernet, ARINC 664, TTEthernet and Time Sensitive Networking under three properties i.e. their quality of service capabilities, their synchronization capabilities and their fault tolerance capabilities.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - This paper proposes a method to efficiently map the legacy Ethernet-based traffic into Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) traffic classes considering different traffic characteristics. Traffic mapping is one of the essential steps for industries to gradually move towards TSN, which in turn significantly mitigates the management complexity of industrial communication systems. In this paper, we first identify the legacy Ethernet traffic characteristics and properties. Based on the legacy traffic characteristics we presented a mapping methodology to map them into different TSN traffic classes. We implemented the mapping method as a tool, named Legacy Ethernet-based Traffic Mapping Tool or LETRA, together with a TSN traffic scheduling and performed a set of evaluations on different synthetic networks. The results show that the proposed mapping method obtains up to 90% improvement in the schedulability ratio of the traffic compared to an intuitive mapping method on a multi-switch network architecture. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents the latest Ethernet standardization of in-vehicle network and the future trends of automotive ethernet technology. The proposed system provides a design and optimization algorithm of in-vehicle networking technologies related Ethernet Audio Video Bridge (AVB) technology. We present a design of in-vehicle network system as well as the optimization of AVB for automotive. A proposal of Reduced Latency of Machin to Machine (RLMM) plays a significant role in reducing the latency between devices. The approach of RLMM on realistic test cases indicated that there was a latency reduction about 30.41% It is expected that the optimized settings for the actual automotive network environment can greatly shorten the time period in the development and design process. The results achieved from the experiments on the latency present in each function are trustworthy since average values are obtained via repeated tests for several months. It would considerably benefit the industry because analyzing the delay between each function in a short period of time is tremendously significant. In addition, through the proposed real-time camera and video streaming via optimized settings of AVB system, it is expected that AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithms in autonomous driving will be of great help in understanding and analyzing images in real time. © 2022 River Publishers.

AB  - Deterministic latency is an urgent demand to pursue the continuous increase in intelligence in several real-time applications, such as connected vehicles and automation industries. A time-sensitive network (TSN) is a new framework introduced to serve these applications. Several functions are defined in the TSN standard to support time-triggered (TT) requirements, such as IEEE 802.1Qbv and IEEE 802.1Qbu for traffic scheduling and preemption mechanisms, respectively. However, implementing strict timing constraints to support scheduled traffic can miss the needs of unscheduled real-time flows. Accordingly, more relaxed scheduling algorithms are required. In this paper, we introduce the flexible window-overlapping scheduling (FWOS) algorithm that optimizes the overlapping among TT windows by three different metrics: the priority of overlapping, the position of overlapping, and the overlapping ratio (OR). An analytical model for the worst-case end-to-end delay (WCD) is derived using the network calculus (NC) approach considering the relative relationships between window offsets for consecutive nodes and evaluated under a realistic vehicle use case. While guaranteeing latency deadline for TT traffic, the FWOS algorithm defines the maximum allowable OR that maximizes the bandwidth available for unscheduled transmission. Even under a non-overlapping scenario, less pessimistic latency bounds have been obtained using FWOS than the latest related works. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - TSN (Time Sensitive Networks) is an attractive solution for latency-critical frame transmission built upon IEEE 802 architecture for automotive Ethernet. In particular, IEEE 802.1Qbv defines a time-triggered communication paradigm with the addition of a time-aware shaper governing the selection of frames at the egress queues according to a predefined schedule. In contrast, IEEE 802.1Qch proposes another scheduling mechanism called CQF (Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding) based on the original IEEE 802.1Qbv time-aware scheduling. This paper focuses on studying the performance of Ethernet with IEEE 802.1Qch enhancement and comparing the performance between IEEE 802.1Qbv and IEEE 802.1Qch. In order to describe the scheduling mechanism, this paper proposes the scheduling algorithms of the two different scheduling mechanisms. Then, implementing the above scheduling algorithm in OMNeT++, an open-source network simulator. Lastly, comparing the performance of the two algorithms, end-to-end delay is collected to assess the performance. In this way, a result shows that the CQF has a better performance about the jitter of end-to-end delay than the time-aware scheduling mechanism, but CQF increases the worst end-to-end delay. However, a single mechanism is imperfect, and the study on the two scheduling mechanisms working in coordination needs to be further researched. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Reliability is one of the major concerns of Time Sensitive Networking (TSN). Current systems mostly rely on static redundancy to protect functionality from permanent component failures. This greatly increases the cost of Time-Triggered (TT) flows. Instead, Software Defined Networking (SDN) enables dynamic redundancy. Disrupted traffic can be rerouted by a centralized controller to reduce the cost while maintaining reliability. This paper presents an approach to compute alternative paths at run-time and analyze their impact on reliability. We define a novel three-mode recovery scheme, which includes full functionality, reduced functionality, and emergency halt modes. Run-time recovery for TT flows is explored using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and a heuristic algorithm. Then, a Markov chain-based design-time reliability analysis is developed to evaluate the Mean Time to Reduced Functionality Mode (MTTRF) and Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) of run-time recoverable systems. Our experiments show that run-time recovery provides better protection against multi-point failures than static redundancy. Compared with the state of the art, our proposed ILP has better routing efficiency. The proposed heuristic algorithm can perform routing and scheduling in polynomial time, but it tends to route multicast flows to longer paths than ILP. Furthermore, when applied to realistic recovery scenarios, our proposed ILP improves the MTTF by up to 2times and the average execution time by up to 20times than the raw ILP of the state of the art. Although less efficient with multicast flows, the heuristic algorithm achieves similar reliability as the ILP, and its worst-case recovery time is below 100ms on an embedded ARM processor.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Graph neural network (GNN) is an advanced machine learning model, which has been recently applied to encode Ethernet configurations as graphs and predict their feasibility in terms of meeting deadlines constraints. Ensembles of GNN models have proven to be robust to changes in the topology and traffic patterns with respect to the training set. However, the moderate prediction accuracy of the model, 79.3% at the lowest, hinders the application of GNN to real-world problems. This study proposes improvements to the base GNN model in the construction of the training set and the structure of the model itself. We first introduce new training sets that are more diverse in terms of topologies and traffic patterns and focus on configurations that are difficult to predict. We then enhance the GNN model with more powerful activation functions, multiple channels and implement a technique called global pooling. The prediction accuracy of ensemble of GNNs with a combination of the suggested improvements increases significantly, up to 11.9% on the same 13 testing sets. Importantly, these improvements increase only marginally the time it takes to predict unseen configurations, i.e., the speedup factor is still from 50 to 1125 compared to schedulability analysis, which allows a far more extensive exploration of the design space. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - In the field of transportation, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an important component of the Internet of Things. The vehicle-to-vehicle communication is particularly challenging in mobile IoV networks because they are operated in complex and highly variable environments. The mobile IoV transmission interruption level can be evaluated by the outage probability (OP) performance. If the OP performance can be analyzed and predicted accurately, the Quality of Service (QoS) in the mobile IoV networks can be improved. However, the analysis and prediction of mobile IoV transmission channels is very challenging because they are highly dynamic. In this article, the analysis and prediction of the OP performance for mobile IoV networks are investigated. A hybrid decode-amplify-forward (HDAF) relaying scheme with transmit antenna selection (TAS) is considered. The exact OP expressions are derived in a closed form, and the analytical results are verified. To realize the real-time analysis of the OP performance, an intelligent OP prediction algorithm based on the improved cuckoo search (ICS) is presented. The proposed algorithm is compared with different methods and the results show that it has a better OP prediction performance. The prediction accuracy of ICS-BP can be increased by 51.8% compared with the existing algorithms. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - With the rapid increase in the proportion of electronic products used in automobiles, the scale and complexity of in-car systems are increasing day by day. The requirements for automobile safety, energy conservation, emission reduction, and comfort are also growing. Under such a development trend, the bandwidth demand of the onboard network is also increasing. It demands that the onboard network can carry various high-speed data transmissions. To overcome this problem, automotive Ethernet becomes one of the best solutions in such a trend by establishing communication links between related ECUs, allowing ECUs to use more advanced functions and share data. Meanwhile, Time Sensitive Network (TSN) is dedicated to developing more powerful functions to realize an ultra-low delay control network. Time synchronization and time-aware scheduling are the core of TSN protocol. In this paper, we propose a new architecture of the TSN-based Ethernet driver working model for time-aware scheduling to improve the performance of the deterministic delays of the time-sensitive stream. TSN only guarantees the communication delay but does not make requirements for the controllers. To support the real-time scheduling mechanism of TSN, the Ethernet controller's working model must change. Due to the more considerable amount of data to be processed, the driver's occupation management of the controller's running resources becomes more critical. At the same time, due to the need for real-time scheduling, the message sending behavior is constrained, and it cannot run in the event-based triggering mode like traditional Ethernet drivers. We also implement our architecture on an embedded system and evaluate the performance of the time-aware scheduling based on our architecture.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Traditional in-vehicle networks are statically deployed and configured during the car manufacturing process. However, the growing need for supporting new in-car traffic flows, e.g., to add new camera-based Advanced Driver Assistant Systems (ADAS) or infotainment applications, generates an increasing demand for bandwidth and requires the ability for re-configuring the bandwidth allocation among flows during the vehicle lifecycle. For this reason, this work proposes a partitioning system for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) that allows introducing new flows in the in-vehicle network without affecting the already existing ones. Moreover, the letter presents a simulative assessment of the proposed approach in a realistic automotive scenario. © 1997-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The next era of industrial communication is said to be based on Ethernet time-sensitive networking (TSN). Current migration strategies enable a communication of existing industrial Ethernet (IE) devices over Ethernet TSN networks. Isochronous communication based on scheduled traffic and a free topology choice are mostly not possible for these devices. This work approaches an improved migration strategy that includes a new bridge mode called time-aware forwarding (TAF) that is compatible with Ethernet TSN and that can be implemented with existing Profinet hardware. It enables scheduled traffic and a free topology choice for existing devices at the same time.  © 2007-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) can help standardize deterministic Ethernet across industrial automation. The deterministic guarantee of TSN is based on network resource scheduling in the unit of flow. However, the state-of-the-art TSN single flow scheduling scheme cannot meet the coordinated scheduling requirements of multiple data flows in advanced industrial applications (e.g., control and safety applications). In this article, we propose a TSN chain flow abstraction, TC-Flow, for a coordinated multiple-flow scheduling model in industrial control and safety applications. Based on the proposed TC-Flow model, we design an offline TC-Flow scheduling algorithm using integer linear programming and an online heuristic TC-Flow scheduling algorithm to handle network dynamics. To deploy the proposed TC-Flow model and scheduling algorithms in the TSN, we design a CF-TSN network architecture that is compatible with the existing TSN single-flow scheduling scheme. Finally, we implement the proposed CF-TSN architecture and TC-Flow scheduling algorithms in real-world network environments. Experimental results show that the proposed scheduling algorithms can increase the number of schedulable flows by 26 percent compared to the state-of-the-art TSN scheduling benchmark. © 1986-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Time-sensitive networks (TSNs) support not only traditional best-effort communications but also deterministic communications, which send each packet at a deterministic time so that the data transmissions of networked control systems can be precisely scheduled to guarantee hard real-time constraints. No-wait scheduling is suitable for such TSNs and generates the schedules of deterministic communications with the minimal network resources so that all of the remaining resources can be used to improve the throughput of best-effort communications. However, due to inappropriate message fragmentation, the realtime performance of no-wait scheduling algorithms is reduced. Therefore, in this paper, joint algorithms of message fragmentation and no-wait scheduling are proposed. First, a specification for the joint problem based on optimization modulo theories is proposed so that off-the-shelf solvers can be used to find optimal solutions. Second, to improve the scalability of our algorithm, the worst-case delay of messages is analyzed, and then, based on the analysis, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to construct low-delay schedules. Finally, we conduct extensive test cases to evaluate our proposed algorithms. The evaluation results indicate that, compared to existing algorithms, the proposed joint algorithm improves schedulability by up to 50%. © 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.

AB  - The pervasiveness of network softwarization has drawn keen interest from industrial domain as network convergence becomes increasingly desirable amongst industrial operators. Coupled with the concept of network slicing, operators will be able to tailor resources to applications regardless of the contrast in application requirements. However, while the concept of slicing is prevalent in industrial network circles, the realization of the concept in practical deployment scenarios is rarely emphasized. This paper provides a step-by-step analysis for the creation of dynamic network slices to guarantee real-time deterministic requirements of periodic industrial applications. The objective of the paper is achieved by the design and integration of worst-case delay models in the virtual network embedding problem with a focus on the behavior of time-sensitive forwarding mechanisms introduced in standard Ethernet bridges. The result shows that the approach is able to guarantee delay requirements irrespective of the arrival order of slices. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - In many emerging Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) applications such as industrial control and automotive, periodic traffic with end-to-end latency constraints is buffered with nonmission-critical aperiodic traffic. As queueing delay is a central component of end-to-end latency, we study the effect of aperiodic traffic on the queueing delay of periodic traffic via characterizing the probability distribution of queue size and delay in an (M + D)/M/1 queue, a queue with Poisson and periodic inputs, infinite waiting capacity and a single memoryless server. Since obtaining the closed form distributions of the queue size and delay is intractable, we approximate the behavior of the (M + D)/M/1 queue when the service and arrival rates are close. We use a Markov chain with a quasitoeplitz matrix, enabling us to use an existing technique to study this class of Markov chains. We determine the transition matrix of the Markov chain, investigate the setting in which the approximation works well, and compute the stationary distribution. We plot and compare the stationary distributions of queue size and delay between the (M + D)/M/1 queue and our model; we observe that our model is a favorable match.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Deterministic and low latency communications are increasingly becoming essential requirements for several safety-critical applications, such as automotive and automation industries. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an element of the new IEEE 802.1 standards that introduced Ethernet-based amendments to support these applications. One of these enhancements was presented in IEEE 802.1Qbv to define the time-aware shaping (TAS) technique for time-triggered (TT) traffic scheduling. The TAS mechanism is window-based scheduling using a gating system controlled by the gate control list (GCL) schedules in all nodes. Although several scheduling algorithms have been proposed to investigate the effects of window-related parameters on network performance, the offset difference ( $OD$ ) between the same-class windows in the adjoining nodes has not been optimized yet. These optimizations are extremely crucial to implement less pessimistic latency schedules. This paper proposes an optimized flexible window-overlapping scheduling (OFWOS) algorithm that optimizes TT window offsets based on latency evaluations considering the overlapping between different priority windows at the same node. First, we formulate the GCL timings as mathematical forms under variable $OD\text{s}$ between the same-priority windows. Then, an analytical model is implemented using the network calculus (NC) approach to express the worst-case end-to-end delay ( $WCD$ ) for TT flows and evaluated using a realistic vehicular use case. The OFWOS model optimizes $OD$ under all overlapping situations between TT windows at the same node. Compared with the latest works of 3-hop and 30-hop TSN connections, the OFWOS reduces the $WCD$ bounds by 8.4% and 32.6%, respectively, accomplishing less pessimistic end-to-end latency bounds.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In this work, we present and analyze methods and mechanisms for interconnecting a network slice control and management system of the mobile network, with an IEEE Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) control plane. IEEE TSN is gaining momentum as a key technology that is able to provide network service guarantees for Ethernet-based communications. Although Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) have been thoroughly investigated in 5G, incorporating TSN technologies in the Transport Network is expected to unleash the potential of end-to-end deterministic communications, especially in industrial environments and time-critical applications like factory automation.We elaborate on the concepts of a TSN-aware Xhaul network, present a novel architecture, and describe a set of amendments required in order to enable network slicing. With the devised approach, a slice-aware TSN-enabled transport network can be controlled and managed in an end-to-end orchestrated way. Implementation experience and evaluation results are reported using TSN-enabled prototype devices, OpenAirInterface (OAI), and JOX slice orchestrator.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group specifies a set of standards that enables real-time communication with predictable and bounded delays over the Ethernet. Specifically, TSN introduces a new set of so-called shapers, which regulate traffic arrival and transmission in the networks. Prominent among those are the IEEE 802.1 Qbv Time Aware Shaper (TAS) and IEEE 802.1Qav Credit-Based Shaper (CBS). Another traffic control mechanism is the IEEE 802.1Qbu Frame Preemption. Most works in the literature have focused on the quantitative performance comparison between these mechanisms. However, the discussion on how they compare in terms of implementation cost has received less attention. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of the implementation cost of the aforementioned TSN traffic control mechanisms. This comparison can help system designers in choosing which of the mechanism(s) to deploy for their applications. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The demands for deterministic network services are getting significant. IEEE Time sensitive networking (TSN) task group has aimed for deterministic services through IEEE 802 networks. TSN’s solutions rely on the time-synchronization and the slot scheduling coordinated throughout a network. The former requires costly hardware implementations for accuracy and scalability. The latter requires a schedulability analysis, which is proven to be NP-complete and not scalable. For modest-to-large scale dynamic networks, a more flexible solution is necessary. We propose a scalable framework that guarantees any desired jitter upper bound, including zero jitter. The framework is composed of; packets with relative time-stamps, a network that guarantees latency bounds, and buffers at the network egress. The latency bounds of a network can be of any value. The buffer holds packets for predetermined intervals to reproduce arbitrary inter-arrival intervals to inter-departure intervals, based on the network’s latency bound. The idea behind the proposed framework is to minimize the latency first with work-conserving schedulers, and then adjust the jitter at the egress of a network. We argue that this is simpler than minimizing latency and jitter at the same time. A direct benefit of such simplicity is its scalability. We examine the network solutions that guarantee latency bound, such as the DiffServ and the Flow aggregate-interleave regulator (FAIR), as the candidates for the component in the framework. We show with a case study and simulations that the proposed framework can guarantee smaller latency bounds, with zero jitter, than those of the TSN’s synchronous approach. © 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc..

AB  - TSN or Time-Sensitive Network is an accumulation of standards that can provide the Ethernet network with an extension to support the real-time application while maintaining the safety-critical distribution with the hardware. To enhance real-time guarantees, TSN adopts several shaping Credit-Based Shaping, Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS), Burst-Limiting Shaper (BLS), and scheduling mechanisms such as Time Aware Shaper (TAS) and numerous types of traffic are integrated. In modern industries, the increasing number of traffic and data is causing latency to increase significantly. To minimize the end-to-end delay, it is highly required to have lossless compress data. This paper proposes some pre-existing lossless compression algorithms (Huffman, LZW, RLE), which are well suited for the TSN network. It can improve the end-to-end delay despite increasing data, and it is applicable for the worst-case scenarios as well. Moreover, the focus of this research is confined to the CBS shaping mechanism. For the validation of our statement, various traffic such as Control Data Traffic (CDT), Audio Video Bridging (AVB) class A, AVB class B, and best-effort have been simulated using OMNeT++. Comparisons are shown in terms of end-to-end delay between the compressed and the uncompressed data, and end-to-end delay has been improved for all classes.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Although networks based on 802 standards were initially designed to transport best-effort traffic, they now can accommodate all sorts of traffic, including time-sensitive ones. The latter is possible through a group of standards developed and maintained by the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group. This set of protocols ensures bounds and latency guarantees for streams of periodically arriving data. However, no bounds or guarantees are specified for stochastically arriving data. In this work, we propose an approximation for the end-to-end average latency that randomly arriving frames experience in a flow over a TSN path. These are non-scheduled frames arriving at a scheduled network. We based our approximation on a classic model from urban traffic literature called Fixed-Cycle Traffic Light (FCTL). Our approach is effective and extremely fast to compute compared to exact models or simulations. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - This paper proposes a new paradigm for control plane in Time Sensitive Networks (TSN). An SDN controller proactively instructs network elements on the reconfigurations to perform locally if some specific events occur (e.g., failures, performance degradations). Instructions are given in the form of Finite State Machines (FSMs), which store information related to the actions that each network element should execute to react against a specific event. Thus, if such event occurs, the SDN controller is by-passed reducing reaction (e.g., recovery) time. Such an approach is here implemented for recovery upon failures in TSN. Experiments of failure recovery are carried out and measurements are presented comparing the FSM-based solution with a fully-centralized reactive restoration. Moreover, the proposed approach is compared through simulations against Frame Replication and Elimination for Reliability. Results will show how proactive FSM manipulation can strongly reduce recovery time in SDN-based TSN networks without overloading the network with frame replicas.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Motivated by new use cases such as industrial automation and in-vehicle communication, Time-Sensitive Networking is further improving the layer 2 standards for real-time communication in Ethernet networks. As periodic traffic is a common requirement in such scenarios, the Time Aware Shaper (TAS) is a highly popular mechanism that allows the realization of real-time guarantees in synchronized networks. Most applications in literature suggest to configure the TAS for full stream isolation such that the lowest delays can be achieved. However, this 'zero-queuing' strategy requires a high amount of computational resources and time, as the configuration of the gate control lists of each port is a complex task, which is not suitable for scenarios with dynamically changing requirements. This paper presents a novel approach with shared time windows. In combination with stream reservation techniques that are commonly applied for asynchronous mechanisms, the network is able to accept new streams during operation without complex reconfiguration, while still benefiting from some degree of isolation compared to conventional asynchronous shapers. The evaluation shows that, given the right circumstances, the number of accepted real-time streams can be improved significantly. © 2021 IFIP.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a set of standardised communication protocols developed under the IEEE 802.1 working group. TSN aims to support deterministic communication based on network schedules that are distributively configured. It is widely considered as the future in-vehicle network solution for highly automated driving, where the requirement on timing guarantee is alongside the demand of high communication bandwidth. In this work, we study a setting of periodic control and non-control packets, with implicit and arbitrary deadlines, respectively. As the FIFO (first-in, first-out) queues in the 802.1Qbv switch incur long delay in the worst case, which prevents the control tasks from achieving short sampling periods and thus impedes control performance optimisation, we propose the first fixed-priority scheduling (FPS) approach for TSN by leveraging its gate control features. In this context, we develop a finer-grained frame-level response time analysis, which provides a tighter bound than the conventional packet-level analysis. Building upon FPS and the above analysis, we formulate a co-design optimisation problem to decide the sampling periods and poles of real-time controllers with settling time as the objective to minimise, whilst satisfying the schedulability constraint. © 2020 Association on Computer Machinery.

AB  - We propose a Software-Defined Network (SDN)based approach for ultra-fast recovery of Time Sensitive Networks (TSN) in the case of failure events. We exploit the Source Routing paradigm for explicit path control and the creation of a stateless TSN data plane. We further propose a TSN failure recovery routing heuristic used to minimise link congestion, while we also introduce the concept of TSN subgraphs to quickly reschedule the flows traversing the problematic area. We evaluate our approach using SDN-based Source Routing and Linux-based TSN scheduling integrated into Mininet. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a set of amendments that extend Ethernet to support distributed safety-critical and real-time applications in the industrial automation, aerospace, and automotive areas. TSN integrates multiple traffic types and supports interactions in several combinations. In this article, we consider the configuration supporting scheduled traffic (ST) based on gate-control lists, audio-video bridging (AVB) traffic according to IEEE 802.1BA that has bounded latencies, and best-effort traffic, for which no guarantees are provided. This article extends the timing analysis method to multiple AVB classes and proofs the credit bounds for multiple classes of AVB traffic, respectively, under frozen and nonfrozen behaviors of credit during guard band (GB). They are prerequisites for nonoverflow credits of credit-based shaper (CBS) and preventing starvation of AVB traffic. Moreover, this article proposes an improved timing analysis method reducing the pessimism for the worst-case end-to-end delays of AVB traffic by considering the limitations from the physical link rate and the output of CBS. Finally, we evaluate the improved analysis method on both synthetic and real-world test cases, showing the significant reduction of pessimism on latency bounds compared to related work and presenting the correctness validation compared with simulation results. We also compare the AVB latency bounds in the case of frozen and nonfrozen credit during GB. Additionally, we evaluate the scalability of our method with variation of the load of ST flows and of the bandwidth reservation for AVB traffic. © 1982-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The state of the art for real-time factory-floor communications consists of a variety of protocols and technologies that aid in timely data exchange through the network. The majority of these are of a fieldbus type, running on a wired link like Ethernet. The choice of medium widely reflects the desire for high reliability. This attribute, reliability, is an indispensable condition for any industrial communications. Many industrial communication technologies exist, of which the most prominent are: PROFINET, EtherNet/IP, Sercos III, EtherCAT, and OPC UA. Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a relative newcomer in this arena, known for the strict synchronisation it maintains between communicating entities, among other things. This work presents and distinguishes between these various technologies, showing how they compare to one another, and also looking into how they may possibly coexist. The assessment can be used by African industries as they take the first steps in defining the factory-floor of the future, enabled by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. © 2021 IST-Africa Institute and Authors.

AB  - This paper presents SPHERE, a project aimed at the realization of an integrated framework to abstract the hardware complexity of interconnected, modern system-on-chips (SoC) and simplify the management of their heterogeneous computational resources. The SPHERE framework leverages hypervisor technology to virtualize computational resources and isolate the behavior of different subsystems running on the same platform, while providing safety, security, and real-time communication mechanisms. The main challenges addressed by SPHERE are discussed in the paper along with a set of new technologies developed in the context of the project. They include isolation mechanisms for mixed-criticality applications, predictable I/O virtualization, the management of time-sensitive networks with heterogeneous traffic flows, and the management of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) to provide efficient implementations for cryptography modules, as well as hardware acceleration for deep neural networks. The SPHERE architecture is validated through an autonomous driving use-case.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - To extend industrial Ethernet to guarantee real-Time quality-of-service (QoS), the IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group has been developing a series of specifications, including the flow control series, of which Credit-Based Shaping (CBS) and Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) were defined in IEEE 802.1 Qav standard and IEEE 802.1 Qcr draft respectively. While CBS is a per-class scheduling strategy, ATS is a per-flow scheduling. To analyze performance of these flow control strategies, comparison among CBS, ATS and Strict Priority Queuing (SPQ) is performed using a suite of self-developed models. Models were implemented and operated in the OMNeT++ simulation platform. Moreover, CBS and ATS are implied in different network load. And the results show that ATS flow control strategy can provide better real time performance guarantee for aperiodic traffics than CBS in heavy network load.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The next generation fronthaul interface (NGFI) architecture has been specified recently in the IEEE P1914.1 standard for packet-based fronthaul transport networks. NGFI is a flexible and cost-effective solution developed for meeting stringent latency and throughput requirements of future centralized and virtualized radio access networks (C-RAN/vRAN) in the 5th generation mobile networks (5G). NGFI allows for splitting baseband processing functions of a radio frequency signal between radio unit (RU), distributed unit (DU), and central unit (CU), where each of these elements may be located at a different site of the network. In the NGFI network, the radio data to be processed is transmitted between the RU, DU, and CU in the form of packets and routed by means of packet switches over a common packet-based fronthaul transport network. In this paper, we address a basic optimization problem in an NGFI network that concerns allocation of transmission resources in network links for the RU–DU and DU–CU data flows assuming quality of service (QoS) requirements related to maximal latency of these flows. To formulate the latency-aware flow allocation (LFA) optimization problem, we apply the mixed integer programming (MIP) approach. To generate solutions to larger LFA problem instances, we develop a meta-heuristic algorithm. To account for latency constraints in both MIP and meta-heuristic, we make use of a worst-case latency estimation model. The results of numerical experiments run in three network topologies for different network instances show the effectiveness of the meta-heuristic method, when compared to the MIP approach. These results also allow us to assess the performance of the NGFI network considered. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A unified network architecture, allowing for simultaneous transmission of multiple real-time (RT) and non-RT traffic classes, is becoming increasingly important for the realization of industrial IoT. There is yet no clear approach allowing multiple state-of-the-art Industrial Ethernet applications, exhibiting different isochronous hard real-time traffic patterns, to share the same network resources alongside best-effort traffic. This paper presents an approach to integrating heterogeneous Industrial Ethernet applications over Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN). We deploy different real-time schedulers that are embedded in a Software-defined Network (SDN) controller to allow different applications with various traffic patterns and Qualityof-Service (QoS) requirements to share the same network. This integration is accomplished by providing an abstraction that combines the requirements of the Industrial Ethernet application and the TSN network capabilities and constraints. © 2020 IFIP.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a collection of standards that extend Ethernet to support safety-critical and real-time applications. TSN integrates multiple traffic types, i.e., Time-Triggered (TT) traffic scheduled based on Gate-Control-Lists (GCLs), Audio-Video-Bridging (AVB) traffic that requires bounded latencies, and Best-Effort (BE) traffic, for which no guarantees are provided. This paper proposes a Network Calculus-based approach to determine the worst-case end-to-end delays of AVB traffic in a TSN network with both non-preemption and preemption modes. We consider the effects of TT traffic due to GCLs, 'guard bands', i.e., time windows that block other traffic from transmitting, and preemption overhead on the service for AVB traffic. We provide a proof of non-overflow condition for AVB credit, which is used to control the AVB traffic transmission. The analysis method is evaluated on realistic test cases, and compared to related work. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Emerging applications such as industrial automation, in-vehicle, professional audiovideo, and wide area electrical utility networks require strict bounds on the end-to-end network delay. Solutions so far to such a requirement are either impractical or ineffective. Flow based schedulers suggested in a traditional integrated services (IntServ) framework are O(N) or O(log N), where N is the number of flows in the scheduler, which can grow to tens of thousands in a core router. Due to such complexity, class-based schedulers are adopted in real deployments. The classbased systems, however, cannot provide bounded delays in networks with cycle, since the maximum burst grows infinitely along the cycled path. Attaching a regulator in front of a scheduler to limit the maximum burst is considered as a viable solution. International standards, such as IEEE 802.1 time sensitive network (TSN) and IETF deterministic network (DetNet) are adopting this approach as a standard. The regulator in TSN and DetNet, however, requires flow state information, therefore contradicts to the simple class-based schedulers. This paper suggests non-work conserving fair schedulers, called ‘regulating schedulers’ (RSC), which function as a regulator and a scheduler at the same time. A deficit round-robin (DRR) based RSC, called nw-DRR, is devised and proved to be both a fair scheduler and a regulator. Despite the lower complexity, the input portbased nw-DRR is shown to perform better than the current TSN approach, and to bind the end-toend delay within a few milliseconds in realistic network scenarios. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Ethernet has become one of the most researched network technologies for modern, safety-critical, distributed systems due to its maturity and low cost. Standard Ethernet, however, is unsuitable for safety-critical applications due to its lack of delivery guarantees and lack of delay bounds. The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group proposes several extensions to Standard Ethernet to address these shortcomings. One of the proposed extensions is the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS, IEEE 802.1Qbv-2015) which introduces a gate mechanism that enables scheduled transmissions and minimal jitter for high-priority messages. In order to achieve low jitter for these messages, guard bands are inserted into the schedule of the other traffic classes to ensure that the outgoing link is idle when the transmission of the high-priority message is scheduled to occur. This can result in wasted bandwidth. In this work, we propose Size-Based Queuing (SBQ) - an approach to improve bandwidth utilization in TSN networks that utilize TAS and guard bands. After a detailed description of SBQ, we provide a method to schedule an SBQ-enabled TSN network and conduct a qualitative analysis of the impact of SBQ on the transmission time of messages and the improvements on bandwidth utilization. We show that SBQ can reduce the amount of wasted bandwidth in a network, without impacting the transmission of high-priority messages or requiring extensive changes of the TSN network. © 2018 Copyright retained by the authors.

AB  - With the increase in the number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and future requirements for vehicle functions, two SR (Stream Reservation) traffic classes may not be sufficient to ensure fulfilment of constraints for multiple traffic types with individual timing requirements transmitted in the Ethernet-AVB (Audio Video Bridging) networks. The goal of this paper is to determine the worst-case delay for an additional SR traffic class under the CBS (Credit-Based Shaper) algorithm. Delay evaluation is based on the impact analysis of CBS on different priority flows, particularly depending on when the credits of both SR class A and B drain from the worst-case perspective. More specifically, both the impact of CBS and the evolution trends of credit on different priority class flows are first analyzed from the worst-case perspective. Then, for an additional SR class, two types of worst-case delay models are established with the CBS configuration suggestions. Finally, an approach to calculate the worst-case queuing delay is proposed. Moreover, the worst-case end-to-end delay is determined by the network calculus approach and simulation. Numerical results show that the delay bounds of our models are tighter than those of other models, which is beneficial to the development of Ethernet-AVB for in-vehicle networking. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Increasing heterogeneity of industrial network systems is a fact and the chances that in the future one communication standard will be able to fulfill the requirements of all possible applications are utopian. With the increasing number of communication systems, their management, configuration, and maintenance become a significant issue. Additionally, due to the increasing amount of network services and traffic, the management of available network resources and the possibility of delivering certain levels of communication quality of service, especially across different network solutions becomes a big challenge. Therefore, in this paper a Controller of Controllers (CoC) concept for management of heterogeneous industrial networks is proposed. The concept is designed to support still widely spread legacy fieldbus systems, different Ethernetbased industrial solutions, and potentially upcoming network technologies. The goal is achieved by leveraging state-of-theart architectural concepts such as software-defined networks, which allows for integration of abstract models in network management. The concept is described and discussed by way of a demonstrator concept for a heterogeneous system of fieldbus and Ethernet-based time-sensitive networks. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) becomes a dominant technology, both in automotive networks and industrial communication systems. Recent amendments to IEEE 802.1 and 802.3 standards, delivered by several TSN working groups, allowed for deterministic and synchronized communication on top of Ethernet infrastructure. One such amendment introduces a frame preemption mechanism, which enables low-priority traffic to be interrupted by time-critical frames of higher priority. In this paper, we describe an implementation of the frame preemption mechanism on a low-cost FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) platform. The functionality of the implemented design has been verified using industry standard tools and the verification results are reported in the paper. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - We compute bounds on end-to-end worst-case latency and on nodal backlog size for a per-class deterministic network that implements Credit Based Shaper (CBS) and Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS), as proposed by the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standardization group. ATS is an implementation of the Interleaved Regulator, which reshapes traffic in the network before admitting it into a CBS buffer, thus avoiding burstiness cascades. Due to the interleaved regulator, traffic is reshaped at every switch, which allows for the computation of explicit delay and backlog bounds. Furthermore, we obtain a novel, tight per-flow bound for the response time of CBS, when the input is regulated, which is smaller than existing network calculus bounds. We also compute a per-flow bound on the response time of the interleaved regulator. Based on all the above results, we compute bounds on the per-class backlogs. Then, we use the newly computed delay bounds along with recent results on interleaved regulators from literature to derive tight end-to-end latency bounds and show that these are less than the sums of per-switch delay bounds. © 2018 ITC Press.

AB  - Traditionally, industrial networks rely on field bus to support real-time applications. In the trend of industrial internet of things (IIoT), traffic load has increased dramatically, and industrial networks are moving towards time-sensitive networking (TSN), which is based on the widely used Ethernet. In TSN, the time-triggered mechanism is a promising technology for real-time control due to its ability to provide deterministic latency and jitter guarantees. However, this mechanism is mainly based on offline computed schedules, making it difficult to satisfy dynamic requirements in data transmission of IIoT. In this paper, we propose an adaptive group routing and scheduling (AGRS) approach in multicast time-sensitive networks. The framework of this approach contains three phases including pre-processing, schedule synthesis, and post-processing phases. While the pre-processing phase first prunes unnecessary links and adaptively groups qualified complete subgraphs of the network to obtain a simplified topology, the schedule synthesis phase then jointly considers routing and scheduling processes based on the simplified topology to improve schedulability. Finally, the post-processing phase handles the scheduling results of previous phases to generate a feasible schedule. Experiments show that our approach improves schedulability by 68% and reduces execution time by 74% for multicast time-sensitive networks compared with existing approaches. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of standards that enables the industry to provide real-time guarantees for time-critical communications with Ethernet hardware. TSN supports various queuing and scheduling mechanisms and allows the integration of multiple traffic types in a single network. Network Calculus (NC) can be used to calculate upper bounds for latencies and buffer sizes within these networks, for example, for safety or real-time traffic. We explain the relevance of NC for TSN-based computer communications and potential areas of application. Different NC analysis approaches have been published to examine different parts of TSN and this paper provides a survey of these publications and presents their main results, dependencies, and differences. We present a consistent presentation of the most important results and suggest an improvement to model the output of sending end-devices. To ease access to the current research status, we introduce a common notation to show how all results depend on each other and also identify common assumptions. Thus, we offer a comprehensive overview of NC for industrial networks and identify possible areas for future work. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Recent developments in industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) have revolutionized industrial automation systems. However, harsh industrial environment poses great challenges to a time-critical and reliable wireless communication. For instance, effects of multipath fading, noise and co-channel interference can have unpredictable and time-varying impacts on the propagation channel, leading to the failure of on-time packet delivery. To address this problem, in this paper we propose a channel-based Optimal Back-off Delay Control (OBDC) scheme which can minimize the total time a packet spends in the sensor node (TSN) by assessing the features of a generic wireless channel. Specifically, we first explore the channel impairments by investigating the probability density function (PDF) of the level crossing rate (LCR) of the received signal in the industrial wireless environment. Then, with the obtained channel assessment results, we develop a phase-type semi-Markov model to investigate the probability distribution of the back-off delay of a packet in the sensor node (SN). The probability distribution of the back-off delay can be further substituted with TSN according to the queuing theory. The proposed OBDC scheme examines the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the obtained distribution of TSN and the packet arrival rate, and reduces the TSN according to an objective function which is constantly renewed in every transmission round with regard to a delay constraint. The simulation results show that the OBDC scheme can reduce TSN and guarantee to keep the TSN in an acceptable range even though the wireless channel is impaired by interference effects. It also shows that the OBDC scheme can reduce the proportion of packets meeting their deadline to the total packets in transmission when the number of SN and LCR changes. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Future automotive applications ranging from advanced driver assistance to autonomous driving will largely increase demands on in-vehicular networks. Data flows of high bandwidth or low latency requirements, but in particular many additional communication relations will introduce a new level of complexity to the in-car communication system. It is expected that future communication backbones which interconnect sensors and actuators with Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in cars will be built on Ethernet technologies. However, signaling from different application domains demands for network services of tailored attributes, including real-time transmission protocols as defined in the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Ethernet extensions. These Quality of Service (QoS) constraints will increase network complexity even further. Event-based simulation is a key technology to master the challenges of an in-car network design. This chapter introduces the domain-specific aspects and simulation models for in-vehicular networks and presents an overview of the car-centric network design process. Starting from a domain-specific description language, we cover the corresponding simulation models with their workflows and apply our approach to a related case study for an in-car network of a premium car. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - With the development of industrial Internet of Things, many new industrial networks are emerging. Among these networks, the standard of Wireless Networks for Industrial Automation-Process Automation (WIA-PA) is one typical specification for industrial wireless networking, while Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) is another typical specification for industrial wired networking. A factory network often consists of multiple kinds of networks, including wireless media and wired media. Therefore, effective protocol conversion among different industrial networks becomes more and more significant. To address this issue, this paper presents a conversion scheme between WIA-PA and TSN based on data flow mapping. The proposed scheme is composed of a set of conversion methods, including priority conversion method, flow identification conversion method, address conversion method, cross-network clock synchronization method, and bandwidth reservation method. The conversion mechanism is designed in detail and implemented on experimental platform. Test results show that the mutual conversion of data streams of the two networks is achieved effectively by the proposed scheme, while the key network characteristics such as the data stream priorities are maintained. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Information leakage can have dramatic consequences on systems security. Among harmful information leaks, the timing information leakage is the ability for an attacker to deduce internal information depending on the system execution time. We address the following problem: given a timed system, synthesize the execution times for which one cannot deduce whether the system performed some secret behavior. We solve this problem in the setting of timed automata (TAs). We first provide a general solution, and then extend the problem to parametric TAs, by synthesizing internal timings making the TA secure. We study decidability, devise algorithms, and show that our method can also apply to program analysis. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - For time-sensitive networks, as in the context of IEEE TSN and IETF Detnet, cyclic dependencies are associated with certain fundamental properties such as improving availability and decreasing reconfiguration effort. Nevertheless, the existence of cyclic dependencies can cause very large latency bounds or even global instability, thus making the proof of the timing predictability of such networks a much more challenging issue. Cyclic dependencies can be removed by reshaping flows inside the network, by means of regulators. We consider FIFO-per-class networks with two types of regulators: perflow regulators and interleaved regulators (the latter reshape entire flow aggregates). Such regulators come with a hardware cost that is less for an interleaved regulator than for a perflow regulator; both can affect the latency bounds in different ways. We analyze the benefits of both types of regulators in partial and full deployments in terms of latency. First, we propose Low-Cost Acyclic Network (LCAN), a new algorithm for finding the optimum number of regulators for breaking all cyclic dependencies. Then, we provide another algorithm, Fixed- Point Total Flow Analysis (FP-TFA), for computing end-to-end delay bounds for general topologies, i.e., with and without cyclic dependencies. An extensive analysis of these proposed algorithms was conducted on generic grid topologies. For these test networks, we find that FP-TFA computes small latency bounds; but, at a medium to high utilization, the benefit of regulators becomes apparent. At high utilization or for high line transmission-rates, a small number of per-flow regulators has an effect on the latency bound larger than a small number of interleaved regulators. Moreover, interleaved regulators need to be placed everywhere in the network to provide noticeable improvements. We validate the applicability of our approaches on a realistic industrial timesensitive network. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - To support QoS of time-sensitive services in Ethernet, IEEE has proposed a set of standards for transporting and forwarding real-time content over Ethernet known as Audio Video Bridging (AVB) with bandwidth reservation and priority isolation. AVB traffic is granted highest priority to ensure its transmission while low-priority traffic follows Strict Priority (SP). However, due to restrictions of SP algorithm, low-priority traffic may suffer a problem of starvation. To solve the problem, we propose a BP neural network based self-tuning controller (BPSC) over a probability selector to manage the transmission of best effort (BE) traffic in AVB switched Ethernet. This paper introduces the model of BPSC, followed by an simulation to demonstrate that BPSC could operate effectively and dynamically. The result shows that BPSC not only has the ability to manage the transmission precisely, but also shows both effectiveness and robustness. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2018.

AB  - Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) has been extensively utilized to enable the transport of time-sensitive fronthaul flows in Ethernet-bridged networks. However, recently emerged ultra-low delay and jitter requirements of the TSN pose great challenges to Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) over Ethernet. Considering this, we propose a Deterministic Transmittable Time-Based Asynchronous Scheduler (DTT-BAS) in this paper. The DTT- BAS uses the deterministic transmittable timestamp as the core scheduling mechanism, which numerically compares the timestamps to optimize the flow scheduling in the network. For the fronthaul scenario, simulation results validate that the DTT-BAS achieves a high probability of zero jitter and reduces the influence of clock skews with a delay performance close to IEEE 802.1CM frame preemption algorithm. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - IEEE 802.1 Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) enables real-time communication with deterministically bounded network delay and jitter over standard IEEE 802.3 networks ('Ethernet'). In particular, TSN specifies a time-triggered scheduling mechanism in IEEE Std 802.1Qbv implemented by switches to control when outgoing queues get access to switch ports. Besides this time-triggered scheduling mechanism, other scheduling mechanisms can be active in the network at the same time including priority queuing and a credit-based shaper. Moreover, further supporting mechanisms such as the possibility to interrupt frames already in transmission (frame preemption) are specified by the TSN standards. Overall, this leads to a complex network infrastructure transporting both, real-time and non-real-time traffic in one converged network, making it hard to analyze the behavior of converged networks. To facilitate the analysis of TSN networks, we present TSN-specific extensions to the popular OMNeT++/INET framework for network simulations in this paper including, in particular, the time-triggered scheduling mechanism of IEEE Std 802.1Qbv. Besides the design of the TSN simulator, we present a proof-of-concept implementation and exemplary evaluation of TSN networks. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - A homogeneous avionic communication architecture based on the AFDX supporting mixed-criticality applications will bring significant advantages, i.e., easier maintenance and reduced costs. To cope with this emerging issue, the AFDX may integrate multiple traffic classes: Safety-Critical Traffic (SCT) with hard real-time constraints, Rate-Constrained (RC) traffic requiring bounded latencies and Best Effort (BE) traffic with no delivery constraints. These traffic classes are managed based on a Non-Preemptive Strict Priority (NP-SP) Scheduler, where the highest priority traffic (SCT) is shaped with a Burst Limiting Shaper (BLS). The latter has been defined by the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group to limit the impact of high priority flows on lower priority ones. This paper proposes a Network Calculus-based approach to compute the end-to-end delay bounds of SCT and RC classes. We consider the impact of the BLS and the multi-hop network architecture. We also provide proofs of service curves guaranteed to SCT and RC classes, needed to derive delay bounds with Network Calculus. The proposed approach is evaluated on a realistic AFDX configuration. Results show the efficiency of incorporating the TSN/BLS on top of a NP-SP scheduler in the AFDX to noticeably enhance the RC delay bounds while guaranteeing the SCT deadline, in comparison to an AFDX implementing only a NP-SP scheduler. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Ethernet is nowadays a promising communication technology for automotive applications as, comparing with the existing in-vehicle networks, it offers high bandwidth and a significant reduction of cabling costs, while meeting the EMC/EMI requirements of automotive communications. The IEEE 802.1Q standard is one of the base standards of Time-Sensitive Networking. It offers several benefits, such as the real-time support, as it provides bounded latency to time-constrained traffic classes, with zero jitter and congestion-free transmissions, and the capability to handle multiple traffic classes on the same channel. The IEEE 802.1Q standard specifies multiple features, that support different ways to handle the transmission of Ethernet frames. In this paper a comparative performance assessment of three network configurations defined in the IEEE 802.1Q standard for automotive applications are presented. The assessment results are obtained using the OMNeT++ framework. The comparison between the results of these three different network configurations, using realistic traffic patterns, provides a quantitative evaluation of the network performance in terms of maximum end-to-end delays and absolute jitter. © 2019 AEIT.

AB  - Distributed embedded systems for safety-critical applications demand reliable communication with real-time characteristics. Switched Ethernet-based network is a practical and scalable solution that allows high-reliability level through path redundancy. The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standard is being developed to support real-time communication which supports a deterministic and low latency communication for safety-critical control applications, namely, Time-Triggered (TT) traffic class. In addition, a bounded-latency traffic class, namely, Audio Video Bridging (AVB) class is introduced. In this paper, we propose a multipath routing technique which tackles both TT and AVB traffic simultaneously. The proposed approach investigates satisfying path redundancy requirements for each message while the imposed interference from TT traffic on AVB traffic is minimized. The considered routing problem is formalized as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization problem. The Worst Case end-to-end Delay (WCD) is the optimization objective. 50 test cases of various network size and number of messages are solved to evaluate the performance, i.e., interference reduction, and the scalability of the proposed technique. Results demonstrate WCD reduction up to 90% comparing to the typical routing approach that determines TT and AVB routing in separate steps. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - In 5G radio access networks, meeting the performance requirements of the fronthaul network is quite challenging. Recent standardization and research activities are focusing on exploiting the IEEE Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) technology for fronthaul networks. In this work we evaluate the performance of Ethernet TSN networks based on IEEE 802.1Qbv and IEEE 802.1Qbu for carrying real fronthaul traffic and benchmark it against Ethernet with Strict priority and Round Robin scheduling. We demonstrate that both 802.1Qbv and 802.1Qbu can be well used to protect high-priority traffic flows even in overload conditions. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Ethernet is one of the most widely used high-speed interfaces at homes and offices, recently the trend is catching up towards its adoption to the automotive world where a high amount of data to be transported at very high speeds mostly in the infotainment domain. As with Controller Area Network (CAN) which is an automotive communication protocol, Ethernet is also packetized data communication system, where information is transferred in packets between nodes on various parts of the network. Ethernet would be the best candidate for replacing CAN in the future, but the high cost per node is a limiting factor for widespread use of it in an automotive environment. Due to this, it may probably not replace CAN networks in the near future but rather augment it. Reliability and fault-resilience being a characteristic for any automotive domain, the high data rate is an additional requirement for domains such as infotainment because the data that is transported is primarily multimedia. CAN network fail in this aspect, as the supported data rate is not sufficient for multimedia and high quantity sensor data. The alternative, OpenAVB is an open source Audio Video Bridging (AVB) system. In this paper, the customizing OpenAVB software for automotive use cases is discussed and analyzed. Also, it presents at enhancing the OpenAVB stack’s stream reservation process to suit the automotive scenarios to reduce the streaming latency with stream reservation protocol at network startup by performing bandwidth reservation. © BEIESP.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of ongoing projects within the IEEE standardization to guarantee timeliness and low-latency communication based on switched Ethernet for industrial applications. The huge demand is mainly coming from industries where intensive data transmission is required, such as in the modern vehicles where cameras, lidars and high-bandwidth modern sensors are connected. The TSN standards are evolving over time, hence the hardware needs to change depending upon the modifications. In addition, high performance hardware is required to obtain a full benefit from the standards. In this paper, we present a research plan for developing novel techniques to support a parameterized and modular hardware IP core of the multi-stage TSN switch fabric in VHSIC (Very High Speed Integrated Circuit) Hardware Description Language (VHDL), which can be deployed in any Field-Programmable-Gate-Array (FPGA) devices. We present the challenges on the way towards the mentioned goal. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - IEEE 802.1 time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a set of amendments to the IEEE 802.1 standard that enable safety-critical and real-time behavior over Ethernet for the industrial automation and automotive domains. Selected TSN mechanisms offer the possibility to emulate the well-known traffic classes found in mixed-criticality distributed systems: Time-triggered (TT) communication with low jitter and bounded end-to-end latency, audio-video-bridging (AVB) streams with bounded end-to-end latency, and general best-effort messages, which have no timing guarantees. Critical traffic is guaranteed via the global network schedule which is stored in so-called gate control lists (GCLs) and controls the timely behavior of frames for each queue of an egress port. Although researchers have started to propose approaches for the routing and scheduling (i.e., GCL synthesis) of TT traffic, all previous research has ignored lower priority real-time traffic, such as AVB, resulting in TT configurations that may increase the worst-case delays of AVB traffic, rendering it unschedulable. In this paper, we propose a joint routing and scheduling approach for TT traffic, which takes into account the AVB traffic, such that both TT and the AVB traffic are schedulable. We extensively evaluate our approach on a number of synthetic and realistic test cases. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) is an evolving group of IEEE standards for deterministic real-time communication making standard Ethernet technology applicable to safety-critical application domains such as manufacturing or automotive systems. TSN includes several mechanisms influencing the timely forwarding of traffic, in particular, a time-triggered scheduling mechanism called time-aware shaper (TAS) and frame preemption to reduce the blocking time of high-priority traffic by low-priority traffic. Although these mechanisms have been standardized and products implementing them begin to enter the market, it is still hard for practitioners to select and apply suitable mechanisms fitting the problem at hand. For instance, TAS schedules can be calculated for individual streams or classes of traffic, and frame preemption with strict priority scheduling (w/o TAS) might seem to be an option in networks with extremely high data rates. In this paper, we make a first step towards assisting practitioners in making an informed decision when choosing between stream-based TAS, class-based TAS, and frame preemption by comparing these mechanisms in selected scenarios using our TSN network simulation tool NeSTiNg. Moreover, to facilitate the application of class-based TAS, we derive a formula for calculating class-based TAS configuration. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Automotive industry is moving ahead as more sophisticated sensors and ECUs are infused to the in-vehicle networks. Ethernet is emerging as one of the choices for current and future in vehicle networks. Most of the manufacturers have currently based their design on legacy Controller Area Network(CAN). The Flexray and Media Oriented System Transport(MOST) protocols are slowly getting obsolete. The challenge is to retain some of the properties of legacy networks (CAN) such as periodic transmissions, signal packing to packets and event triggering of signals in Ethernet. The objective of the paper is to investigate existing legacy CAN networks and propose a method to implement periodic message transmissions on Ethernet. The methodology can be extended to time sensitive networks for making the best effort traffic deterministic. © 2018 FISITA. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the field of intelligent connected vehicles, as the rate of in-vehicle communication continues to increase, the importance of real-time and reliability requirements has been more prominent. The time-sensitive networking (TSN) task group is dedicated to the amendments for meeting the urgent needs in the industrial field. In the implementation of the TSN, time latency bounds of critical traffic, memory bounds of nodes and utilization of transmission resources are needed to evaluate the feasibility of the TSNs. In this paper, we propose a framework called component-based analysis (CBA) to analyze these properties. In CBA, we use a data model, a resource model, and a component model to construct an abstract model of the TSNs with the system architecture and analyze the feasibility of this abstract model with real-time calculus. Moreover, we discuss the preemption mechanism mentioned in IEEE 802.1Qbu to handle the conflict of different priority queues, which has a serious influence on the resource model of the TSNs. Finally, we validate this framework by performing an analysis on a synthetic case and compare the obtained properties with different conflict handling mechanisms. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The advent of automated and autonomous driving requires decision-making based on high-resolution sensor data. In addition, these systems must react safely and promptly to dynamically changing environmental conditions, e.g. traffic situation, weather etc. In this paper we present the frequently considered isolation mechanisms, standards and concepts for achieving functional safety in automotive systems e.g. 802.1Q, AVB, TSN. However, static configurations, which are introduced by the majority of them, penalizes dynamic communication profiles. Consequently, static network management is no longer sufficient to achieve the required performance level. We show that standardised does not necessarily mean safe 'out of the box' nor performant and that the new design vectors must be taken into consideration. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - While customers rivet their eyes on Wi-Fi 6, in the bowels of the IEEE 802.11 Working Group that creates Wi-Fi standards, the next generation Wi-Fi is being developed. At the very first sight, the new IEEE 802.11be amendment to the Wi-Fi standard is nothing but scaled 11ax with doubled bandwidth and the increased number of spatial streams, which together provide data rates as high as 40 Gbps. A bit deeper dive into the 802.11 activities reveals that 11be will support real-time applications. In reality, 11be introduces many more revolutionary changes to Wi-Fi, which will form a basement for further Wi-Fi evolution. Although by now (May 2020), the development process is at the very early phase without any draft specification, the analysis of the discussion in the 802.11 Working Group gives insights into the main innovations of 11be. In addition to the ones above, they include native multi-link operation, channel sounding optimization that opens the door for massive MIMO, advanced PHY and MAC techniques, the cooperation of various access points. The paper analyzes hundreds of features proposed for the new technology, focusing on the open problems that can be solved by the researchers who want to contribute to the development of 802.11be. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Many industrial players are currently challenged in building distributed CPS and IoT applications with stringent endto-end QoS requirements. Examples are Vehicle-to-X applications, Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) or functionalities in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Currently, there is no comprehensive solution allowing to efficiently program, deploy, and operate such distributed applications. This paper will focus on real-time concerns, in building distributed CPS and IoT systems. Thereby, the focus lies, on the one hand, on mechanisms required inside of the IoT (compute) nodes, and, on the other hand, on communication protocols such as TSN and 5G connecting them. In the authors' view, the required building blocks for a first end-to-end technology stack are available. However, their integration into a holistic framework is missing. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet) is a time-critical network for industrial and avionics applications improved from the Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX). It is standardized by SAE AS6802 and satisfies strict timing transmission by use of a mixture infrastructure to support Time-Triggered (TT), Rate-Constraint (RC) and Best-Effort (BE) traffics. The key feature is a time-triggered communication paradigm according to off-line schedule table based on global synchronization. Three integration methods (preemption, timely block and shuffling) are used to resolve conflict when a TT message gets ready and a RC message is already in transmission. Besides several real-time Ethernet solutions, Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) shows great interests and attractions to satisfy the increasing and variable transmission requirements for automotive and aeronautical industry. TSN is comprised of several IEEE standards developed under IEEE 802.1 TSN Task Group, such as 802.1AS, 802.1Qav, 802.1Qat, 802.1BA, 802.1Qbv and 802.1Qbu. On top of SPQ (Static Priority Queuing) scheduling mechanism, with best effort traffics in parallel, TSN introduces guaranteed timing behavior with focus on the transportation for Control Data traffic (CDT) under Time Aware Shaper (TAS) and audio video streams under Credit-Based Shaper (CBS). This paper introduces the basic principles of TSN standard in details, compares it with the properties of the TTEthernet standard. In particular, we first investigate their clock synchronization algorithms and discuss their shaping and scheduling strategies for traffic types with individual timing requirements. Then we show the impact the hard real-time traffic has on soft real-time traffic and give the worst case end-to-end latency calculation. Finally, we determine whether TSN offers flexibility for the requirements of avionic. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The industrial communication market is dominated by Ethernet-based fieldbus systems. Although they share similar requirements and market segments, their implementations and ecosystems differ considerably. As a result, end customers and device manufacturers are faced with a multitude of technologies that need to be produced, run, diagnosed, maintained, and kept in stock. Although the availability of products and services is largely satisfactory, dealing with multiple solutions generates high costs and limits IoT capability. This paper introduces Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture Time-Sensitive Networking (OPC UA TSN) as a new technology and presents the current view. This time, the industrial prospects of fulfilling industrial communication requirements while leveraging the cost benefits of standard Ethernet hardware in the midterm are in reach. We anticipate that OPC UA TSN will reveal itself as a game changer in the field of industrial automation, being a candidate for establishing a holistic communication infrastructure from the sensor to the cloud. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - ARM TrustZone technology is widely used to provide Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) for mobile devices. However, most TEE OSes are implemented as monolithic kernels. In such designs, device drivers, kernel services and kernel modules all run in the kernel, which results in large size of the kernel. It is difficult to guarantee that all components of the kernel have no security vulnerabilities in the monolithic kernel architecture, such as the integer overflow vulnerability in Qualcomm QSEE TrustZone and the TZDriver vulnerability in HUAWEI Hisilicon TEE architecture. This paper presents MicroTEE, a TEE OS based on the microkernel architecture. In MicroTEE, the microkernel provides strong isolation for TEE OS's basic services, such as crypto service and platform key management service. The kernel is only responsible for providing core services such as address space management, thread management, and inter-process communication. Other fundamental services, such as crypto service and platform key management service are implemented as applications at the user layer. Crypto Services and Key Management are used to provide Trusted Applications (TAs) with sensitive information encryption, data signing, and platform attestation functions. Our design avoids the compromise of the whole TEE OS if only one kernel service is vulnerable. A monitor has also been added to perform the switch between the secure world and the normal world. Finally, we implemented a MicroTEE prototype on the Freescale i.MX6Q Sabre Lite development board and tested its performance. Evaluation results show that the performance of cryptographic operations in MicroTEE is better than it in Linux when the size of data is small. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Ethernet TSN is an upcoming communication standard for industrial distributed embedded systems with high demands on bandwidth and traffic delay. In this paper, we present and prove an improved analysis to determine bandwidth reservations for credit based shapers in a single Ethernet TSN switch. We compare this new analysis, which is based on eligible intervals, to the state-of-the-art bandwidth reservation analysis based on busy periods through experiments. Despite its low complexity and the independence of the knowledge of the interfering traffic, the results show an improvement of efficiency, i.e., a decrease of the required bandwidth, for the new analysis. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The automotive industry is swiftly moving towards Ethernet as the high-speed communication network for in-vehicle communication. There is nonetheless a need for protocols that go beyond what standard Ethernet has to offer in order to provide additional QoS to demanding applications such as ADAS systems or audio/video streaming. The main protocols currently considered for that purpose are IEEE802.1Q, AVB with the Credit Based Shaper mechanism (IEEE802.1Qav) and TSN with its Time-Aware Shaper (IEEE802.1Qbv). AVB/CBS and TSN/TAS both provide efficient QoS mechanisms and they can be used in a combined manner, which offers many possibilities to the designer. Their use however requires dedicated hardware and software components, and clock synchronization in the case of TAS. Previous studies have also shown that the efficiency of these protocols depends much on the application at hand and the value of the configuration parameters. In this work, we explore the use of "pre-shaping" strategies under IEEE802.1Q for bursty traffic such as audio/video streams as a simple and efficient alternative to AVB/CBS and TSN/TAS. Pre-shaping means inserting on the sender side "well-chosen" pauses between successive frames of a transmission burst (e.g., as it happens when sending a camera frame), all the other characteristics of the traffic remaining unchanged. We show on an automotive case-study how the use of pre-shaping for audio/video streams leads to a drastic reduction of the communication latencies for the best-effort streams while enabling to meet the timing constraints for the rest of the traffic. We then discuss the limitations of the pre-shaping mechanism and future works needed to facilitate its adoption. © 2018 SAE International. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) network systems confront bandwidth resource sharing challenge constantly, with the objective to obey strict timing requirements. In traditional avionics network, the deterministic QoS guarantees are maintained by precise offline configuration during the design period. However, considering the increasing flexibility and variable scale of avionics systems in recent years, it is inevitable to develop a new network framework that can adapt to scalability. Thus, a Software Defined Networking (SDN)-based avionics network is explored to reduce the complexity and integration overheads for upgrading, which must meet bandwidth and end-to-end latency requirements both. SDN possesses the advantages with global visibility and flexibility management of flows for safety critical applications, but it could not support real-time guarantee for traffic transmission in the network. Nevertheless, the centralized SDN can be an effective implement to combine SDN and bandwidth resource allocation for Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) in avionics network. And it is revealed that the Time Aware Shaper (TAS) and Credit Based Shaper (CBS) play key roles in bandwidth allocation for TSN to obtain deterministic traffic transmission behaviors, which also shows great interests to automotive and industrial communications. In this paper, we first propose a SDN-based framework for traffic bandwidth allocation in avionics network, which can significantly enhance bandwidth reservation management during real-time network communication. Then, we introduce a heuristic algorithm to resolve traffic bandwidth allocation problem, and derive multiple scheduling constraints to support traffic transmission with low and bounded latency and further ensure safety-critical communication. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate our method, and we also discuss trade-offs to optimize the required calculation time, thus can be flexible adopted in safety-critical and time-sensitive applications. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing as well as evolving security threats and vulnerabilities and the state-of-the-art countermeasures in Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled smart grids. The cybersecurity risks in smart grid networks and associated devices prevail in the form of malicious use leading to data espionage, physical damage to devices, intentional denial of service and exploitation for financial gain. We begin with an introduction to IoT and data transfer techniques between different devices, and their role and significance in the growth of smart grids. We then discuss privacy concerns, and various attack motives with which intruders try to break into smart grids. This is followed by a classification of threat actors in modern networks based on the sophistication of attacks they can launch. We also provide a classification of threat vectors in smart grids including attacks against integrity, attacks against availability, attacks against privacy and attacks against authentication. In addition, we investigate the nature and extent of risk posed by advanced persistent threats and the significance of deploying next generation intrusion detection systems in smart grids. The seven-step attack procedure known as cyber kill-chain is discussed and current detection, prevention, and access control measures in practice are also summarized in form of tables. These tables would help the reader correlate prevalent and futuristic attack techniques, countermeasures, and the applicability, scalability and feasibility of current security mechanisms to smart grids for achieving effective cyber hygiene. The paper then introduces novel attack surfaces that inevitably get established due to various cutting-edge communication techniques used in smart grids. One such mechanism discussed in the paper is time sensitive networking that injects the possibility of harnessing time as an attack surface. Based on the current survey, several recommendations for further research are discussed at the end of this paper. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, we ask if Machine Learning (ML) can provide a viable alternative to conventional schedulability analysis to determine whether a real-time Ethernet network meets a set of timing constraints. Otherwise said, can an algorithm learn what makes it difficult for a system to be feasible and predict whether a configuration will be feasible without executing a schedulability analysis? To get insights into this question, we apply a standard supervised ML technique, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and compare its accuracy and running times against precise and approximate schedulability analyses developed in Network-Calculus. The experiments consider different TSN scheduling solutions based on priority levels combined for one of them with traffic shaping. The results obtained on an automotive network topology suggest that k-NN is efficient at predicting the feasibility of realistic TSN networks, with an accuracy ranging from 91.8% to 95.9% depending on the exact TSN scheduling mechanism and a speedup of 190 over schedulability analysis for 106 configurations. Unlike schedulability analysis, ML leads however to a certain rate “false positives” (i.e., configurations deemed feasible while they are not). Nonetheless ML-based feasibility assessment techniques offer new trade-offs between accuracy and computation time that are especially interesting in contexts such as design-space exploration where false positives can be tolerated during the exploration process. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Distributed safety-critical applications in industrial automation, aerospace, and automotive, require worst-case end-to-end latency analysis for critical communication flows in order to prove their correct behavior in the temporal domain. With the advent of time sensitive networks (TSNs), distributed applications can be built on top of standard Ethernet technologies without sacrificing real-time characteristics. The time-based transmission selection and clock synchronization mechanism defined in the TSN enable the real-time transmission of frames based on a global schedule configured through so-called gate control lists (GCLs). This paper has an enhancement of allowing a mixture of the priority-based scheduling and time-triggered, which expand the solution space for the GCLs. Then, it is necessary to analyze the latency bounds for the critical traffic in the TSN network. In this paper, we start from the assumption that the GCLs, i.e., the communication schedules, and the traffic class (priority) assignment for critical flows are given for each output port and derive, using network calculus, an analysis of the worst-case delays that individual critical flows can experience along the hops from sender to receiver(s). Our method can be employed for the analysis of the TSNs where the GCLs have been created in advance, as well as for driving the GCL synthesis that explores a larger solution space than previous methods, which required a complete isolation of transmission events from different traffic classes. We validate our model and analysis by performing experiments on both synthetic and real-world use-cases, showing the scalability of our implementation as well as the impact of certain GCL properties (gate overlapping and traffic class assignments) on the worst-case latency of critical communication flows. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Industrial automation networks are composed of cyber-physical systems where frame delays and jitter influence significantly the quality of communication between control and field devices. Due to these constraints, such systems are often served by dedicated Fieldbus networks which are different from networks for enterprise-level connectivity. However, with the introduction of Time-sensitive Networking standards which are already integrated into IEEE 802.1Q-2018 standards in essential parts, the long expected single converged network for any-type communication in the field, control, and enterprise level is within reach. With it, comes the challenge of synthesizing schedules to obtain parameters for configuring the network bridges for time-triggered communication services.This paper provides a scheduling verification, and Gate Control event computation algorithm focused on asserting the viability of scheduling communication services for multiple independent periodic Talker applications on IEEE 802.1Q- Time Sensitive Networks as well as the computation of Gate Control Lists for the bridges. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - With the interconnection of distributed devices from different industrial automation networks, heterogeneous traffics with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements increase dramatically. Shapers in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) enable the coexistence of different industrial traffics within a single network infrastructure. In this paper, with full consideration of the time-criticality of different industrial traffics and shaping mechanisms, we propose a network calculus-based modeling scheme for the widely-used Credit Based Shaper (CBS) and Time Aware Shaper (TAS). Then, we analyze the QoS of industrial traffics with different real-time characteristics by CBS and TAS, respectively. To evaluate the accuracy of network calculus-based modeling scheme, we compare our theoretical analysis with simulations, wherein a compactness function is defined to describe QoS compactness. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of proposed modeling scheme, by which we further validate both CBS and TAS can satisfy the QoS of traffics for different industrial automation scenarios. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we model and analyse the timing performance of an extended AFDX standard, incorporating the Burst Limiting Shaper (BLS) proposed by the Time Sensitive Networking group. The extended AFDX will enable the interconnection of different avionics domains with mixed-criticality levels, e.g., current AFDX traffic, Flight Control and In-Flight Entertainment. First, we present the model and the worst-case timing analysis, using the Network Calculus framework, of such an extended AFDX to infer real-time guarantees. Secondly, we conduct its performance evaluation on a representative AFDX configuration. Results show the tightness of the proposed model, with reference to simulation results. Moreover, they confirm the efficiency of incorporating the BLS in the AFDX standard to noticeably enhance the medium priority level delay bounds, while respecting the higher priority level constraints, in comparison with the current AFDX standard. © 2018 IEEE.

In this work, we explore the use of “pre-shaping” strategies under IEEE802.1Q for bursty traffic such as audio/video streams as a simple and efficient alternative to AVB/CBS and TSN/TAS. Pre-shaping means inserting on the sender side “well-chosen” pauses between successive frames of a transmission burst (e.g., as it happens when sending a camera frame), all the other characteristics of the traffic remaining unchanged. We show on an automotive case-study how the use of pre-shaping for audio/video streams leads to a drastic reduction of the communication latencies for the best-effort streams while enabling to meet the timing constraints for the rest of the traffic. We then discuss the limitations of the pre-shaping mechanism and future works needed to facilitate its adoption. © 2018 SAE International. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Machine learning (ML), and supervised learning in particular, can be used to learn what makes it hard for a network to be feasible and try to predict whether a network configuration will be feasible without executing a conventional schedulability analysis. A disadvantage of ML-based timing verification with respect to schedulability analysis is the possibility of 'false positives': configurations deemed feasible while they are not. In this work, in order to minimize the rate of false positives, we propose the use of a measure of the uncertainty of the prediction to drop it when the uncertainty is too high, and rely instead on schedulability analysis. In this hybrid verification strategy, the clear-cut decisions are taken by ML, while the more difficult ones are taken by a conventional schedulability analysis. Importantly, the trade-off achieved between prediction accuracy and computing time can be controlled. We apply this hybrid verification method to Ethernet TSN networks and obtain, for instance in the case of priority scheduling with 8 traffic classes, a 99% prediction accuracy with a speedup factor of 5.7 with respect to conventional schedulability analysis and a reduction of 46% of the false positives compared to ML alone. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Flow control is of particular importance in TimeSensitive Networking (TSN), where timeliness of messages is guaranteed through several types of traffic shaping. This has given rise to a number of papers discussing the worst-case response time analysis of, in particular, the credit-based traffic shaping approach. In this work-in-progress paper, we concern ourselves with the possibility that traffic shaping can be applied in different layers of the protocol stack, e.g., the physical layer and link layer, which may give rise to different credit behaviors. We convey our concern that the analysis performed in literature seems to assume application of traffic shaping in the physical layer, and that the analysis therefore cannot be readily used in a context where shaping is applied in a higher layer. In particular, assuming application of credit-based shaping in the link layer, there are different interpretations possible for credit behavior. Depending on the interpretation, some of the basic properties of credit, that are crucial for the analysis, may no longer be valid after overhead is added by the physical layer. As an ongoing effort, we plan to revisit the eligible interval analysis of [1] with an adaptation for a link layer interpretation of the standard concerning application of traffic shaping. © 2020 IEEE.

In this regard, the paper discusses ongoing work and presents preliminary results using a TSN simulator. The results indicate that several parameters of the high priority traffic such as periods, offsets and preemption modes can have a significant impact on the quality of service (e.g., guaranteed message delivery and message delays) of the BE traffic. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Many network applications, e.g., industrial control, demand ultra-low latency (ULL). However, traditional packet networks can only reduce the end-to-end latencies to the order of tens of milliseconds. The IEEE 802.1 time sensitive networking (TSN) standard and related research studies have sought to provide link layer support for ULL networking, while the emerging IETF deterministic networking (DetNet) standards seek to provide the complementary network layer ULL support. This paper provides an up-to-date comprehensive survey of the IEEE TSN and IETF DetNet standards and the related research studies. The survey of these standards and research studies is organized according to the main categories of flow concept, flow synchronization, flow management, flow control, and flow integrity. ULL networking mechanisms play a critical role in the emerging fifth generation (5G) network access chain from wireless devices via access, backhaul, and core networks. We survey the studies that specifically target the support of ULL in 5G networks, with the main categories of fronthaul, backhaul, and network management. Throughout, we identify the pitfalls and limitations of the existing standards and research studies. This survey can thus serve as a basis for the development of standards enhancements and future ULL research studies that address the identified pitfalls and limitations. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Currently, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) require high bandwidth network. Ethernet supports 100Mbit / s bandwidth, which is worth using in future automotive networks. However, unlike CAN, which is widely used in automotive networks, Ethernet does not support the priority of the frame, so it can not guarantee Quality of Service (QoS). IEEE802.1Q (802.1Q) and IEEE802.1AVB (AVB) of the IEEE802 Ethernet standard have a priority mechanism, but there is a difference. The existing papers analyze QoS of 802.1Q and AVB in simulation environment. In this paper, we compare the QoS of 802.1Q and AVB in a network environment implemented with embedded system and multiple switches. So AVB and 802.1Q analyze the QoS according to the priority mechanism. © 2017 Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems - ICROS.

AB  - In the past decades, the evolution of Industrial Inter-net of Things (IIoT) and Industry 4.0 faces several challenges, and one of them is the proprietary network which causes a rising cost due to the interoperability, compatibility, and strict requirements. To deal with the challenge, industry advocates an open Ethernet-based standard under the IEEE 802.1 family, named Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), to support real-time and critical applications, where the routing with TSN is still an open and ongoing research problem. Although there are some existing routing approaches, they are offline algorithms and thus not suitable for future industrial automation that needs to support dynamic reconfiguration. Also, they consider either only TSN traffic or only AVB traffic to determine the routing paths, which limits the overall solution space and fails to make the best use of TSN features. To address the issues above, we aim to explore an online routing problem considering both TSN and AVB traffic in a TSN network. It is very first to investigate the online routing problem considering both TSN and AVB traffic. We propose an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based approach with a low time complexity to solve the problem. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms a well-known solution in terms of the schedulability, performance, number of rerouted streams, and computational efficiency. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - With the development of hardware virtualization and cloud computing, modern industry has a tendency to upgrade from the traditional industrial networks to virtual machine (VM) based networks. To provide firm latency guarantees for control messages in these networks, the time-sensitive network (TSN) is a promising technology due to its determinacy for real-time applications. However, TSN faces the challenge of providing a rapid response to dynamic transmission requirement changes incurred by VM migrations. In this paper, we proposed an online scheduling approach to deal with dynamic VM migrations in multicast TSN. In this approach, we devise a novel online scheduling framework [minimal distance tree (MDT) construction-heuristic breadth first search] containing an offline scheduling phase and an online rescheduling phase. While the offline phase introduces a MDT to increase reusable scheduling results, the online phase proposes a heuristic scheduling approach to reuse the results of the offline phase as much as possible to accelerate the rescheduling process. Experiments show that our framework can provide a rapid response to dynamic VM migrations compared with the existing approaches where the amount of control data does not exceed 50% of the bandwidth. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - With the increasing performance requirements for the IVN (in-vehicle network), the automotive Ethernet is gradually being applied in high bandwidth sub-networks with the help of an AVB (Audio Video Bridging) standard set. To support control and safety-critical data, TSN (Time-Sensitive Networking, the next generation of AVB) is proposed to provide deterministic services for IEEE 802 networks, and many research studies have shown its excellent performance with the help of simulation and calculation tools. In the case of applying the Ethernet for IVN subnets and backbones, it is expected to have a similar or better level of performance compared with the CAN bus. This paper describes one approach to build a real automotive Ethernet network with flow control, real-time and redundancy abilities in TSN. The network topology, traffic streams, hardware/software development and validation are presented to show the process during the invehicle Ethernet network development. The results show that the expected performance of the automotive Ethernet network can be reached with proper network design and node implementation. © 2018 Indian Pulp and Paper Technical Association.

AB  - Type 2N von Willebrand disease (VWD) is characterized by impaired factor VIII (FVIII) binding to von Willebrand factor (VWF). Type 2N VWD patients generally exhibit mild bleeding tendency, but some exhibit a more severe hemorrhagic pattern. An assay for assessing hemostatic potential and predict clinical severity could significantly improve clinical management in these patients. We examined the relationship between bleeding score (BS) and the potential for thrombus formation in whole blood from type 2N VWD patients with various BS using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and microchip flow-chamber system (T-TAS®). Collagen-coated PL-chips, or thromboplastin- and collagen-coated AR-chips, were utilized in the T-TAS to assess platelet thrombus formation at high shear flow, or fibrin-rich platelet thrombus formation at low shear flow, respectively. Neither ROTEM nor the T-TAS using PL-chips reflected the BS. The AR-chip parameters in the T-TAS, however, were highly sensitive to different BS levels among these patients, despite similar FVIII/VWF-related measurements including FVIII/VWF binding. Additionally, the results with AR-chip assay were restored to normal after infusions of FVIII/VWF concentrates in the most severe patients. The data indicate that T-TAS using AR-chips may be a useful assay for predicting clinical severity and assessing therapeutic efficiency in type 2N VWD patients. © 2019, Japanese Society of Hematology.

AB  - The Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group has added a set of mechanisms to Ethernet in order to provide a real-time network. In particular, the output port scheduling based on a Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) algorithm, that was introduced formerly by the Audio-Video Bridging (AVB) task group, has been enhanced with a time driven Gate Control List (GCL). This implies some update in the credit evolution rules, and several solutions may exist. In this paper, we compare the solution used in the standard with another one used in most papers, and also with a third one, designed as a tradeoff between the two others. The comparison is first done on some hand-made examples, showing some credit overflow and unfairness potential problems. Then, simulations are done on a single switch with 3 CBS queues. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.

AB  - The communication system of the next-generation train control system (TCS) based on cloud computing is modeled in this paper. The end-to-end communication delay is analyzed as the main factor affecting the real-time performance of the system. To improve this performance, a time-sensitive network (TSN) is introduced into the system. We analyze and simulate the end-to-end communication delay of systems with the TSN and compare it with traditional Ethernet. It is concluded that applying a TSN, based on the nw-DRR scheduling algorithm and with optimized parameters, can significantly reduce the end-to-end communication delay decreases from tens of milliseconds to milliseconds. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

AB  - This paper proposes an approach to model switched Ethernet communication within a model-and component-based software development framework for vehicular distributed embedded systems. The paper also presents a method to extract the network timing model from the systems that use switched Ethernet networks. In order to provide a proof of concept, an existing industrial component model and its tool suite, namely RCM and Rubus-ICE respectively, are extended by implementing the modeling technique, the timing model extraction method and response-time analysis of the Ethernet AVB protocol. The extensions to RCM are backward compatible with the modeling and end-to-end timing analysis of traditional in-vehicle networks and legacy (previously developed) vehicular distributed embedded systems. Furthermore, the paper discusses the implementation and test strategy used in this work. Finally, the usability of the modeling approach and implemented timing analysis is demonstrated by modeling and time analyzing a vehicular application case study with the extended component model and tool suite. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The overall Industry 4.0 (I4.0) developments combined with the disruptive process of IT-based digitalisation create a vast amount of new opportunities but also challenges for the industrial automation domain. The combination of hybrid (wired wireless) communication architectures, already widely installed legacy technologies, new approaches, such as Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) or 5G, and the general heterogeneity of the industrial landscape results in a high configuration complexity. This creates the necessity for future-proof industrial communication network management systems. Therefore, this paper summarises the current state of the art in this area in order to identify the specific requirements towards future industrial network management systems. The most promising candidate is the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) concept. To evaluate SDN as a possible enabler, specified industrial requirements are compared with the current technological and conceptual capabilities of SDN. In addition, drawbacks resulting in future research questions are identified. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - To cope with the strict reliability requirements of safety-critical ADAS applications, the upcoming TSN standard introduces mechanisms that enable transmission redundancy at any switch or end node. However, it is up to the designer to decide at which points and for which messages to activate transmission redundancy. This significantly increases the design space and requires to trade-off reliability with other routing-related design objectives like network load, transmission timing, or the monetary cost of the hardware. As a remedy, this paper a) presents two different exact approaches to generate feasible redundant message routings and b) proposes an extension of the state-of-the-art approach for the multi-objective routing optimization, enabling the optimizer to directly adjust system features that are relevant for the design objectives. A case study with an application from the automotive domain compares the optimization capabilities of the presented approaches for the routing generation and demonstrates the significant gain in optimization power that is achieved with the proposed optimization extension. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) introduces standardized mechanisms that add real-time capabilities to IEEE 802.1 Ethernet networks. In particular, the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) can be used to send frames in a deterministic fashion according to a predefined global schedule. Existing methods for generating the global communication schedule enforce isolation either in the time or in the space domain. This extended abstract presents a novel, more flexible window-based scheduling algorithm which removes the previously required isolation constraints for Scheduled Traffic (ST) by integrating worst-case delay analysis to guarantee bounded latency. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The IEEE 802.1 time sensitive networking working group has recently standardized the time aware shaper (TAS). The TAS provides deterministic latency guarantees but requires tight time synchronization in all network switches. This paper thoroughly evaluates the mean and maximum packet delays and packet losses of the TAS for a typical industrial control ring network for random (sporadic) and for periodic traffic. We propose and evaluate adaptive bandwidth sharing and adaptive slotted window mechanisms to make TAS adaptive to traffic fluctuations. This paper further evaluates the asynchronous traffic shaper (ATS), which has been proposed to provide low latency network service without the need for time synchronization in network nodes. Our evaluations indicate that TAS with proper configurations, e.g., accurate and precise gating schedules, generally achieves the specified latency bounds for both sporadic and periodic traffic. In contrast, ATS performs relatively well for sporadic traffic; but struggles for moderate to high loads of periodic traffic. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of IEEE standards that extend Ethernet for safety-critical and real-time applications. TSN is envisioned to be widely used in several applications areas, from industrial automation to in-vehicle networking. TSN supports mixed-criticality applications via multiple traffic classes: Time-Triggered (TT) communication, Audio-Video-Bridging (AVB) streams with bounded end-to-end latency as well as Best-Effort messages. TT traffic is scheduled via Gate Control Lists (GCLs) specified for each queue of an egress port. Although researchers have started to propose approaches for the GCL synthesis, all the work so far has ignored lower priority real-time traffic such as AVB, resulting in GCLs that increase the worst-case delays of AVB traffic rendering it unschedulable. In this paper, we propose a GCL synthesis approach based on a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure, which takes into account the AVB traffic, such that both TT and the AVB traffic are schedulable. Our approach is evaluated on several test cases. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - To support mixed-criticality applications, the AFDX may integrate multiple traffic classes: Safety-Critical Traffic (SCT) with hard real-time constraints, Rate-Constrained (RC) traffic requiring bounded latencies and Best Effort (BE) traffic with no delivery constraints. These traffic classes are managed based on a Non-Preemptive Strict Priority (NP-SP) Scheduler, where the highest priority traffic (SCT) is shaped with a Burst Limiting Shaper (BLS). The latter has been defined by the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group to limit the impact of high priority flows on lower priority ones. This paper proposes two bandwidth reservation methods for BLS shapers in AFDX networks. The proposed methods are evaluated on a realistic AFDX configuration. Results show their efficiency to noticeably enhance the RC delay bounds and the SCT schedulability, in comparison to an intuitive method. © 2018 Copyright retained by the authors.

AB  - Network elements (e.g., switches), which intermit service, i.e., stop forwarding and transmission of data according to a repeating schedule, can be found in many real-time capable communication networks, e.g., communication networks with TDMA, Ethernet with Time-aware Shapers or low-power wireless networks. The behavior of those network elements depends on the (stationary) properties of the network elements, their schedule, and the current time, as well as the offered traffic load. If a networked real-time system generates traffic flows which are not synchronized to the schedules of the network elements, formal frameworks such as Network Calculus (NC) are highly valuable to derive deterministic guarantees for the communication. In this paper, we show the fundamental implications of modeling time-triggered network elements with service intermittence in NC. We identify two archetypes of network elements with intermittent service, and propose time-variant and time-invariant approaches to derive service curve formulations to model them. We evaluate the differences between time-variant and time-invariant service curves with respect to the overestimation of worst-case backlog and worst-case delay, and we identify schedule properties which influence the tightness of the derived bounds. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Time Sensitive Networks (TSN) emerge as the set of sub-standards incorporating real-time support as an extension of standard Ethernet. In particular, IEEE 802.1Qbv defines a time-triggered communication paradigm with the addition of a time-aware shaper governing the selection of frames at the egress queues according to a predefined schedule, encoded in so-called Gate Control Lists (GCL). Nonetheless, the design of compositional systems with real-time demands requires a proper configuration of these mechanisms to truly achieve the temporal isolation of communication streams with end-to-end timeliness guarantees. In this paper we address how the synthesis of communication schedules for GCLs defined in IEEE 802.1Qbv can be formalized as a system of constraints expressed via first-order theory of arrays (T-A). We formulate the necessary constraints showing the suitability of the theory of arrays and discuss optimization opportunities arising from the underlying scheduling problem. Our evaluation using general-purpose SMT/OMT solvers proves the validity of the approach, scaling well for small-to medium-networks, and exposing trade-offs for the time needed to synthesize a schedule. Furthermore, we conduct a comparison against previous work and conclude the appropriateness of the method as the basis for future TSN scheduling tools. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Audio Video Bridging Ethernet (AVB) [1] is a standard developed by IEEE Audio Video Bridging Task Group based on switched-Ethernet. It is used in the automotive domain. AVB includes flow differentiation service using Fixed Priority (FP) policy. It ensures a class level credit based shaping (CBS) for high priority flows in each switch. A guaranteed upper bound on End-to-end (ETE) delays, in such a network, is mandatory for certification purpose. Some methods such as Compositional Performance Analysis (CPA) or Trajectory Approach (TA) have been designed to determine worst-case ETE delays in AVB networks. The Forward end-to-end delay Analysis (FA) has been initially developed for AFDX network for a First In First Out (FIFO) or FP/FIFO scheduling. In this paper, we extend it to take into account the CBS algorithm to cover also AVB networks. Finally, we apply FA on a sample configuration and compare the results to the aforementioned approach CPA. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Switched Ethernet has been, and will also be increasingly common in current and future real-time and embedded systems. The IEEE 802.1 working group has recently developed standards and technologies, commonly referred to as Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), to enhance switched Ethernet with timeliness and dependability. We address, for the first time, the synthesis problem for the TSN frame preemption standards IEEE 802.3br-2016 and 802.1Qbu-2016 by introducing two new configuration parameters: flow to queue and queue to Express/Preemptable MAC interface assignments. We present an optimization framework to determine these configuration parameters with reliability as the optimization goal. Our proposed framework is shown to outperform commonly used priority-assignment as well as intuitive approaches. © 2019 EDAA.

AB  - Background: The treatment options for patients with therapy refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) are sparse. TAS-102 (FTD/TPI) is a new oral anti-tumour agent composed of a nucleoside analogue, trifluridine, and a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, tipiracil, indicated for patients with mCRC who are refractory to standard therapies. This study summarizes published and unpublished experience with FTD/TPI in clinical practice settings. Patients and methods: The Medline/PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify observational studies on FTD/TPI monotherapy for mCRC. Papers describing use of FTD/TPI monotherapy outside clinical trials in series of patients evaluable for effectiveness were eligible. The outcomes of interest were median progression free survival (mPFS), median overall survival (mOS) as well as mean PFS time restricted to six months (PFS6m) and mean OS time restricted to one year (OS1y). Results of the pooled analyses of observational studies were compared to the results of the Japanese phase II trial and the two phase III trials, RECOURSE and TERRA. Results: Seven published and two unpublished studies with 1008 patients from 64 centres were included for analysis. The pooled mPFS was 2.2 months (95% CI 2.1 to 2.3 months), and the pooled mOS was 6.6 months (95% CI 6.1 to 7.1 months). PFS6m was 2.9 months (95% CI 2.6 to 3.1 months) and OS1y was 6.8 (95% CI 6.0 to 7.5) months. While these results all reflect RECOURSE, the pooled mOS is lower than in the phase II trial and the OS1y is inferior to both the phase II trial and TERRA. Conclusion: This systematic review and a meta-analysis indicates that in real life settings, the survival benefit of FTD/TPI monotherapy in patients with therapy refractory mCRC reflects the outcomes in RECOURSE but is inferior to outcomes in the two Asian efficacy trials.What is already known TAS 102 (Lonsurf) is an oral fixed dose combination of trifluridine (FTD) and tipiracil (TPI) indicated as salvage-line treatment in patients with therapy refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). A Japanese phase II trial and two phase III trials, RECOURSE and TERRA, demonstrated that FTD/TPI prolonged overall survival.What this study adds This systematic review and meta-analysis of real life data from 64 sites indicates that the effectiveness in daily clinical practice settings of FTD/TPI monotherapy in late stage mCRC reflects the outcomes in RECOURCE but is inferior to the outcomes in the Japanese phase II trial and TERRA. © 2019, © 2019 Acta Oncologica Foundation.

AB  - Hemorrhagic diseases are common in dogs. Current coagulation assays do not model all aspects of in vivo hemostasis and may not predict bleeding risk. The Total-Thrombus Analysis System (T-TAS) is a novel hemostasis assay system in which whole blood flows through microfluidic channels at defined shear rates to provide qualitative and quantitative evaluation of platelet function (PL-chip) and coagulation function (AR-chip). The present study evaluated the T-TAS in dogs with hereditary bleeding disorders and with acquired hemorrhagic syndromes (Group 1), and healthy controls (Group 2). Hereditary defects included von Willebrand's disease (VWD; n = 4), hemophilia A (n = 2), and canine Scott syndrome (n = 2). Acquired hemorrhagic disorders included neoplastic hemoperitoneum (n = 2) and acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (n = 1). Citrate anticoagulated samples were collected from diseased dogs (Group 1, n = 11) and controls (Group 2, n = 11) for coagulation screening tests, fibrinogen analyses, D-dimer concentration, antithrombin activity, von Willebrand Factor antigen, PFA-100 closure time (PFA-CT), and thromboelastography (TEG). Citrate and hirudin anticoagulated samples were used for T-TAS analyses at two shear rates. Qualitative thrombus formation in each chip was recorded using the T-TAS video camera. Numeric parameters, derived from the instrument software, included occlusion start time (OST; time to 10 kPa), occlusion time (OT; time to 60 kPa (PL-chip) or 80 kPa (AR-chip)), and area under the pressure curve (AUC). Correlations between continuous variables were evaluated by Spearman's rank. Continuous variables were compared between groups by Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U-test. Alpha was set at 0.05. In combined analyses of all dogs, significant correlations were identified between T-TAS variables, between the PFA-CT and PL-chip parameters and between TEG variables and AR-chip parameters. The prothrombin time correlated with the AR-chip AUC at both shear rates. In Group 1 dogs, the AR-chip AUC at low shear was significantly reduced compared with Group 2 dogs. Aberrant thrombus formation was seen in video images recorded from dogs with VWD and hemophilia A. The T-TAS AR-chip analysis distinguished dogs with bleeding risk compared to healthy controls. Initial evaluations of the T-TAS suggest it may aid characterization of hemostasis in patients at-risk of bleeding and assist with delineating bleeding phenotypes. © Copyright © 2020 Iwanaga, Miura, Brainard, Brooks and Goggs.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the reliability, validity, and sensitivity of a novel device (Notio Konect™) which is purported to provide a real-time analysis of aerodynamic drag area (CdA) during cycling. Design: Observational, cross-sectional study. Methods: Fifteen trained cyclists rode in an indoor velodrome using three different positions (upright, aero [holding aero bars], and optimized aero [similar to aero, but wearing a time-trial helmet]). They completed six 1-min trials in each position. The CdA was measured with Notio and with two other systems (Track Aero System™ [TAS] and a validated mathematical model). Results: The CdA measured with Notio showed good reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.92, 90% confidence interval [CI] = 0.89–0.95). Notio showed an almost perfect relationship with both TAS (ICC = 0.99, 90% CI = 0.98–0.99) and the mathematical model (ICC = 0.99, 90% CI = 0.98–0.99). However, the CdA values provided by the former (0.308 ± 0.051 m2) were significantly higher (albeit with a trivial effect size [ES]) compared with TAS (0.300 ± 0.051 m2, p < 0.001, ES = 0.15) and the mathematical model (0.303 ± 0.051 m2, p = 0.005, ES = 0.09). The CdA was higher in the upright than in the aero position with all systems (all p < 0.001, ES = 1.84–1.89), and higher in the aero than in the optimized aero position when measured with TAS (p = 0.033, ES = 0.22) or the mathematical model (p = 0.024, ES = 0.24), but not with Notio (p = 0.220, ES = 0.19). Conclusions: Notio appears to be reliable, strongly correlated to other established systems, and discerns large (upright vs aero) but not small (aero vs optimized aero) variations in riding position. Further research is needed to confirm its validity in outdoor conditions. © 2019 Sports Medicine Australia

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of worst-case timing analysis of extended Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) networks, incorporating Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) shapers called Burst Limiting Shapers (BLS), to enable the interconnection of different avionics domains with mixed-criticality levels, e.g., current AFDX traffic, Flight Control and In-Flight Entertainment. Conducting such an analysis is a challenging issue when considering multiple BLS-shaped traffic classes, due to the sophisticated inter-dependencies between the different shapers sharing the same output capacity. We tackle this problem through extending the applicability domain of our previous work for computing maximum delay bounds using Network Calculus and considering only one BLS class, called Continuous Credit-based Approach (CCbA), to handle multiple TSN/BLS classes. We provide further insights into the sensitivity and tightness issues of worst-case delay bounds yielded with the Generalized CCbA (GCCbA). Our assessments show that the tightness ratio is up to 85%, with reference to Achievable Worst-Case delays. We also show the improvements against recent state-of-the-art approaches in terms of tightness and complexity, where the computation time is up to 105 faster. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of GCCbA for realistic avionics case studies, e.g., adding A350 flight control traffic to the AFDX. Results show the good applicability of GCCbA and confirm the efficiency of the extended AFDX, which decreases the delay bounds of the existing AFDX traffic by up to 49.9%, in comparison with the current AFDX standard. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Time sensitive networks support deterministic schedules over Ethernet networks. Due to their high determinism, high reliability and high bandwidth, they have been considered as a good choice for the backbone network of industrial internet of things. In industrial applications, the backbone network connects multiple industrial field networks together and has to carry massive real-time packets. However, the off-the-shelf time-sensitive network (TSN) switches can deterministically schedule no more than 1024 real-time flows due to the limited number of schedule table entries. The excess real-time flows have to be delivered by best-effort services because the switch only supports the two scheduling services. The best-effort services can reduce average delay, but cannot guarantee the hard real-time constraints of industrial applications. To make the limited number of schedule table entries support more real-time flows, first, we relax scheduling rules to reduce the requirement for schedule table entries and formulate the process of transmitting packets as a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) specification. Then, we divide the SMT specification into multiple optimization modulo theories (OMT) specifications so that the execution time of solvers can be reduced to an acceptable range. Second, we propose fast heuristic algorithms that combine schedule tables and packet injection control to eliminate scheduling conflicts. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations. The evaluation results indicate that, compared to existing algorithms, our proposed algorithm requires only one-twentieth the number of schedule entries to schedule the same flow set. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Industrial and automation control systems require that data be delivered in a highly predictable manner in terms of time. Time-sensitive Networking (TSN), an extension of the Ethernet, is a set of protocols developed and maintained by the IEEE 802.1 Task Group; the protocols deal with time synchronization, traffic scheduling, and network configuration, etc. TSN yields promising solutions for real-time and deterministic networks. Here, we develop a TSN simulation model based on OMNET++; we model a TSN-enabled switch that schedules traffic using gate control lists (GCLs). Simulation verified that the model guaranteed deterministic end-to-end latency. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Various advanced and mission-critical applications are enabled by the emerging technologies in fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication systems. To ensure improved quality of experience (QoE) of users, 5G and beyond networks require ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). The successful realization of the URLLC entails the advent of new technological concepts. Therefore, this article presents an overview of the enabling techniques for the URLLC. Classification of the enabling techniques is done and an extensive review of the literature is presented to identify the state-of-the-art techniques, limitations, and the potential approaches for alleviating the limitations. It is observed that artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled edge computing and caching solutions are widely explored as promising techniques to effectively guarantee low latency and reliable content acquisition while reducing redundant network traffic and improving the QoE. Therefore, we present a classification of the AI-enabled edge caching solutions and discuss various mechanisms of the caching agents. In particular, we investigate the use of deep learning (DL), deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and federated learning (FL) algorithms. Subsequently, we analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art edge caching schemes and demonstrate the performance gains of FL frameworks over conventional centralized and decentralized DL and DRL frameworks. We confirm that FL edge caching is a viable mechanism in 5G and beyond networks. On the other hand, it is shown that the IEEE 802.1 time sensitive networking and the emerging IETF deterministic networking standards present effective mechanisms when deterministic networks with bounded ultra-low latency are considered. Finally, we present the open issues and opportunities for further research. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - This survey addresses the question if existing realtime capable Internet technologies for wired communication can meet the requirements of future industrial IoT scenarios with a rising number of heterogeneous devices to be connected and increasing amounts of data to be exchanged in real-time. The development towards an industrial IoT is further referred to as Industry 4.0 in Germany and Industrial Internet in the USA, respectively. We first investigate selected widespread technologies at all layers of the ISO/OSI model with respect to their realtime capability, scalability and dynamic reconfiguration, standard compliance and platform complexity as well their capability to integrate non-real-time devices. On the one hand, we note that TSN technology at physical and link layer is standardized but exhibits very high platform complexity for the switches and is thus costly. Subsequently, it is hence discussed if purely software-based approaches can enable RT communication over Ethernet. Moreover, even though TSN-enabled network components can enforce real-time behavior, scheduling and routing algorithms for computing the respective network configuration are not part of the TSN standards. Those algorithms could be executed on a central SDN controller to achieve high performance and realtime capability, however, the scalability of such a centralized approach is limited by the fact that corresponding algorithms have exponential computational complexity. Hence, one of the future research directions outlined proposes to trade off distributed against centralized scheduling and routing approaches with regard to scalability and dynamic reconfiguration, real-time capability, and platform complexity. We conclude there is a need for the advancement of existing and for the development of new, possibly hybrid, real-time capable approaches that combine the advantages of centralized and distributed solution in order to meet all requirements. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Automotive Ethernet is becoming the backbone network of future vehicle because of its large data bandwidth and high communication speed. In order to satisfy the requirements of vehicle communication, the network needs the characteristic of seamless redundancy. IEEE P802.1 CB is one of the TSN (Time-Sensitive Networking) active projects, which provides seamless redundancy character for Automotive Ethernet by frame replication and elimination at flexible position to improve reliability. In this paper, the operating principle of IEEE P802.1 CB was analyzed, including network topology, redundancy tag, sequence generation function, sequence recovery function, timeout mechanism and latent error detection. A network complying IEEE P802.1 CB was simulated in Visual Studio and 7 situations of packet transmission were tested in CppUTest. The results show that when IEEE P802.1 CB is used over a network that are fixed to a specific topology, and that are protected against congestion loss, it can substantially increase seamless redundancy character for the network and is especially suitable for time-critical system. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Packet-switched fronthaul networks are often designed following the rule that the worst-case network delay must be below a given target end-to-end network latency budget. However, the theoretical maximum delay can be too pessimistic in particular scenarios, where the latency budget needs to be a very small or there is a need to stretch the distance between the radio heads and the baseband units. In this paper, we propose to use a very high packet delay percentiles as an alternative to the maximum theoretical delay in order to stretch the range of the fronthaul links at the expense of a higher frame loss ratio (FLR), within the limits established by eCPRI and the IEEE 802.1 CM. Several methods to estimate the percentiles for the \mathbf {I}-{U}~/~\mathbf {II}-{D} eCPRI functional splits are analyzed. Namely, G/G/1 and N∗D/D/1 queueing models are tested and compared with simulation as dimensioning tools. The results support that the N∗D/D/1 queue is able to model the behavior of a packet-switch fronthaul aggregator using the eCPRI standard for 5g New Radio (NR) Fronthaul streams and can be used as a tool to dimension the length of the links. The experiments show that the fronthaul links' lengths can be increased by 60% and 10% for 50- and 100-MHz NR channels, respectively, while keeping the latency budget and frame loss ratio within the IEEE 802.1 CM limits. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This work presents a proven per-hop latency bound for real-time networks with admission control that does not rely on shaping or timed gates. It can be applied in a distributed control plane using only bridge-local information, making it an ideal candidate for brownfield real-time network installations. A brief comparison with Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) shows that the achieved network utilization is comparable to that of ATS in some scenarios, while it only lags behind in scenarios with accumulating bursts where re-shaping could actually reduce the interference of the observed streams. © 2020 IFIP.

AB  - Aiming at high performance, more and more Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) adopt Multiprocessor System-on-Chips (MPSoCs) as computation units. However, due to increasing integration of transistors on a die, the power densities together with performance variations of MPSoC chips have been increasing dramatically. Consequently, the MPSoC-based CPSs might become unsustainable and unreliable. Although various Task Allocation and Scheduling (TAS) heuristics have been proposed to minimize the hotspot time (i.e., duration of thermal emergency) and energy consumption of MPSoC designs, few of them can guarantee the highest performance yield under process variations without violating energy, thermal and timing constraints. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel energy- A nd thermal-aware TAS evaluation and optimization framework. Based on statistical model checking techniques, our approach enables accurate modeling and reasoning of the performance yield of real-time MPSoC designs under joint energy and thermal constraints. To enable system-level design space exploration, we propose a regression analysis-based method that can drastically reduce the overall exploration efforts. Experimental results show that our fully-automated approach can not only allow accurate sustainability-oriented reasoning of TAS solutions under specified thermal and energy constraints, but also enable the quick search of optimal TAS solutions on different MPSoC architectures with the highest performance yield. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Phenotypic differences between closely related taxa or populations can arise through genetic variation or be environmentally induced, leading to altered transcription of genes during development. Comparative developmental studies of closely related species or variable populations within species can help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms related to evolutionary divergence and speciation. Studies of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and related salmonids have revealed considerable phenotypic variation among populations and in Arctic charr many cases of extensive variation within lakes (resource polymorphism) have been recorded. One example is the four Arctic charr morphs in the ~10,000 year old Lake Thingvallavatn, which differ in numerous morphological and life history traits. We set out to investigate the molecular and developmental roots of this polymorphism by studying gene expression in embryos of three of the morphs reared in a common garden set-up. We performed RNA-sequencing, de-novo transcriptome assembly and compared gene expression among morphs during an important timeframe in early development, i.e., preceding the formation of key trophic structures. Expectedly, developmental time was the predominant explanatory variable. As the data were affected by some form of RNA-degradation even though all samples passed quality control testing, an estimate of 3'-bias was the second most common explanatory variable. Importantly, morph, both as an independent variable and as interaction with developmental time, affected the expression of numerous transcripts. Transcripts with morph effect, separated the three morphs at the expression level, with the two benthic morphs being more similar. However, Gene Ontology analyses did not reveal clear functional enrichment of transcripts between groups. Verification via qPCR confirmed differential expression of several genes between the morphs, including regulatory genes such as AT-Rich Interaction Domain 4A (arid4a) and translin (tsn). The data are consistent with a scenario where genetic divergence has contributed to differential expression of multiple genes and systems during early development of these sympatric Arctic charr morphs. © 2018 Gudbrandsson et al.

AB  - Time-sensitive network (TSN) is regarded as the perspective communication network for the intelligent vehicle application because of its reserved bandwidths, QoS mechanisms, low transmission latency. The message scheduling in the TSN have an important influence on the reliability and safety of vehicles. In this paper, the TSN messages between the vehicular electronic control units are classified into the control data traffic (CDT), the stream reservation (SR) and the best effort (BE). A hierarchical scheduling infrastructure for the three types of messages are presented, which consists of three scheduling strategies, i.e., FIFO, CBS and TAS. For the hierarchical scheduling mechanism, the influences of both FIFO and TAS on CBS are analyzed and an approach for the derivation of worst-case response times of SR message is proposed. The experiments in Vector CANoe show that the proposed method in this paper can effectively obtain the upper bound of SR message transmission in TSN. It can be used to improve the design of TSN system. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a time-aware shaper, which is a traffic shaper specifically designed for IEEE 802.1Qbv-compliant time-sensitive networks. The proposed design adopts a software-based approach rather than using a dedicated custom logic chip such as an ASIC or FPGA. In particular, the proposed approach includes a run-time scheduler and a network interface card (NIC) that supports a time-based transmission scheme (i.e., launch-time feature). The run-time scheduler prefetches information (i.e., gate control entry) ahead of time from a given gate control list. With the prefetched information, the scheduler determines a launch time for each frame, and the NIC controls the time at which the transmission of each frame is started in a highly punctual manner. Evaluation results show that the proposed shaper triggers transmission of multiple time-sensitive streams at their intended timings in accordance with a given gate control list, even in the presence of high-bandwidth background traffic. Furthermore, we compare the timing accuracy of frame transmission with and without use of the launch-time feature of the NIC. Results indicate that the proposed shaper significantly reduces jitter of timesensitive streams (to less than 0.1 μs) unlike a baseline implementation that does not use the launch-time feature. © 2020 The Institute of Electronics.

AB  - Over the last two decades, various proprietary modifications have been applied to Ethernet technology to enable deterministic communication required for time-critical systems. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards are under development by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and address hard timing requirements of Ethernet-based distributed applications. The main objective of these standards is to offer an open and vendor-independent networking infrastructure for mixed-critical applications. The support of mixed-criticality reduces heterogeneity of networking technologies and simplifies not only the development but also the integration of distributed applications. However, the scheduling and verification of these networks require advanced expertise and are time-consuming. In this paper, a graphical modeling framework is introduced which facilitates scheduling synthesis and configuration of TSN networks. The created graphical models are automatically translated into a network knowledge base, which is the core of the framework. It is used to process queries regarding infrastructural verification and selective information extraction in order to build scheduling constraints. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Industrial communication requires highly reliable networks with hard temporal constraints. Thus, the IEEE 802.1 Task Group proposed a promising technology, namely, time-sensitive networking (TSN), to complement the determinism and real-time (RT) capabilities of Ethernet via a set of enhanced IEEE standards. To explore the feasibility and applicability of TSN, we developed a simulation model for TSN using a module-based design method. Our TSN-compliant modules implement time-based traffic scheduling functionality to guarantee the deterministic and RT transmission of time-triggered traffic. We validated the developed modules by comparing the end-to-end simulation latencies to those measured in a real-world TSN testbed. The results of this evaluation validate the proposed simulation model and show that it conforms tightly to the TSN specifications and faithfully matches the real-world testbed. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - This article focuses on mixed-criticality applications with functions that have different timing requirements, i.e., hard real-time (HRT), soft real-time (SRT), and functions that are not time-critical (NC). The applications are implemented on distributed cyber-physical systems that use IEEE Time-sensitive Networking (TSN). TSN is the product of an IEEE effort to bring deterministic real-time capabilities to IEEE 802.3 Ethernet. TSN supports the convergence of multiple traffic types, i.e., critical, real-time, and regular “best-effort” traffic within a single network: Time-triggered (TT), where the messages are transmitted based on static schedule tables, Audio-video Bridging (AVB), for dynamically scheduled messages with a guaranteed bandwidth and bounded delays, and Best Effort (BE), for which no timing guarantees are provided. The HRT messages have deadlines, whereas we capture the quality-of-service for the SRT messages using “utility functions.” Given the network topology, the set of application messages, including their routing, and the set of available AVB classes, we are interested in determining the traffic type of each message, such that all the HRT messages are schedulable and the total utility for the SRT messages is maximized. We propose a Tabu Search-based metaheuristic to solve this optimization problem. The proposed proof-of-concept tool has been evaluated using several benchmarks, including two realistic test cases. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - The advent of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) heterogeneous multicore platforms is offering many opportunities in the market of embedded computing systems for many application scenarios. The integration of multiple computing elements in a single device entails impressive performance capabilities. At the same time, the increased complexity of emerging systems requires the integration of more subsystems and functionalities, among others the communication subsystem. This work deals with the desirable properties of software transmission mechanisms to enable TSN communications in heterogeneous platforms handled by a hypervisor. Moreover, preliminary simulation results provide some insights on the limits and the advantages of the investigated architectures. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - In the high-tech and automotive industry, bandwidth considerations and widely accepted standardization are two important reasons why Ethernet is currently being considered as an alternative solution for real-time communication (compared to traditional fieldbusses). Although Ethernet was originally not intended for this purpose, the development of the Ethernet AVB standard enables its use for transporting high-volume data (e.g. from cameras and entertainment applications) with low-latency guarantees. In complex industrial systems, the network is shared by many applications, developed by different parties. To face this complexity, the development of these applications must be kept as independent as possible. In particular, from a network point of view, progress of all communication streams must be guaranteed, and the performance for individual streams should be predictable using only information regarding the stream under study and the general parameters of the communication standard used by the network. Initial methods to guarantee latency for Ethernet AVB networks rely on the traditional busy-period analysis. Typically, these methods are based on knowledge of the inter-arrival patterns of both the stream under study and the interfering streams that also traverse the network. The desired independence is therefore not achieved. In this paper, we present an independent real-time analysis based on so-called eligible intervals, which does not rely on any assumptions on interfering priority classes other than those enforced in the Ethernet AVB standard. We prove this analysis is tight in case there is only a single higher-priority stream, and no additional information on interference is known. In case there are multiple higher-priority streams, we give conditions under which the analysis is still tight. Furthermore, we compare the results of our approach to the two most recent busy-period analyses, point out sources of pessimism in these earlier works, and argue that assuming more information on the sources of interference (e.g. a minimal inter-arrival time between interfering frames) has only limited advantages. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Industrial communication systems represent one of the most important innovations of the last decades in the context of factory and process automation systems. They are networks specifically designed to cope with the tight requirements of these challenging application fields such as real time, determinism, and reliability. Moreover, industrial networks are often deployed in environments characterized by strong electromagnetic interference, mechanical stress, critical temperature, and humidity. Over the last three decades, different classes of industrial networks have been developed according to changing requirements and available communication and information technologies. In this paper, we first provide an account of the state of the art, reviewing classical fieldbuses, real-time Ethernet networks, and industrial wireless networks, along with their most relevant features, applications, and performance figures. We introduce the complex standardization framework and analyze the market status and assumptions for future development. In the second part, we address the future perspectives focusing on new technologies, standards, and fields of application. In particular, we consider the time-sensitive networking (TSN) family of standards, Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) systems, high-performance wireless LANs, industrial applications of cellular networks, and Ethernet networks for automotive communication. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In view of the problem that the current automotive Ethernet AVB protocol stack cannot fully adapt to the vehicle network environment, optimization about the FQTSS protocol in Ethernet AVB is focused on in this paper. Considering the status of current automotive Ethernet AVB protocols stack is conservative, a lightweight Ethernet AVB platform is designed and implemented in this paper. With reference to the relevant standards and specifications given by the AVnu Alliance, a hardware test platform based on STM32 is built. Then, combined with the improved LwIP protocol stack and μC/OS-II operating system, a solution about low-cost, low-overhead, low-latency lightweight automotive Ethernet FQTSS protocol is proposed and implemented. Finally, some necessary test is executed to verify the feasibility of the solution. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Moving towards new technologies, such as Time Sensitive Networking (TSN), in industries should be gradual with a proper integration process instead of replacing the existing ones to make it beneficial in terms of cost and performance. Within this context, this paper identifies the challenges of integrating a legacy EtherCAT network, as a commonly used technology in the automation domain, into a TSN network. We show that clock synchronization plays an essential role when it comes to EtherCAT-TSN network integration with important requirements. We propose a clock synchronization mechanism based on the TSN standards to obtain a precise synchronization among EtherCAT nodes, resulting to an efficient data transmission. Based on a formal verification framework using UPPAAL tool we show that the integrated EtherCAT-TSN network with the proposed clock synchronization mechanism achieves at least 3 times higher synchronization precision compared to not using any synchronization. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Highly reliable, scalable and deployable net-works with strict temporal constraints are inevitable for future cyber physical systems. Due to widespread usage and success of Ethernet technologies, the Time Sensitive Networking task group introduces a series of protocol extensions to the IEEE 802.1 Ethernet standard. These standards provide real time capabilities and performance improvements. Simulation environments are intensively used to investigate correctness and applicability of new protocol suites. This paper presents an OPNET simulation framework for simulating TSN time-based features. Our framework implements ingress time-based policing and enhancements for scheduled traffic as an extensions of the Ethernet standard. We describe the implementation details of our simulation models which provide temporal properties. We also evaluate and compare our results with the expected behaviors of the aforementioned protocols. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - High-quality asynchronous programs are needed urgently to exploit multi-core hardware and cloud platforms. However, in real-time systems, formal models such as timed automata (TAs) are limited to concurrent programs where the number of processes is constant and no process is triggered on-the-fly. To better support the verification of asynchronous programs, we propose a new model called asynchronous multi-process timed automata (APTAs) based on TAs. Processes are abstracted as process timed automata (PTAs), which are almost the same as TAs except some states are for triggering new processes. A multiset is used to buffer triggered instances. The model is sufficiently expressive to describe real-time asynchronous programs with dynamic process creation. We show that the coverability problem, which is used for checking safety property of programs, is decidable by encoding it into read-arc timed Petri nets (RTPNs). We then propose an algorithm for the coverability problem and provide a proof of the termination and correctness. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Future production systems demand for a standardized digital representation of I4.0 components including their capabilities. Many concepts of such a digital representation have been published under the term administration shell. However, these concepts do not explicitly cover the use of administration shells to orchestrate real-time capable I4.0 components. In this paper, we recap an existing I4.0 framework that enables the dynamic orchestration of non-real-time I4.0 components. As main contribution, we integrate real-time capable I4.0 components into this framework. Thereby, the entire communication is standard-compliant to the new real-time technology Time-Sensitive Networking (IEEE 802.1). The advantages of our approach are demonstrated by a dynamic plug-and-produce scenario in which real-time axes are controlled based on G-code. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Large complex industrial Distributed Control Systems (DCS), e.g., power distribution systems, are expected to function for long time, up to 40 years. Therefore, besides having a long system verification phase for all subsystems, the design phase should consider various aspects when it comes to selection of which technologies to utilize when implementing such systems. In this paper, we study and investigate key challenges of using the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) technology when it comes to design, maintenance and evolution of long life-span complex DCS. We also identify issues and challenges, and propose mitigation strategies for using the TSN technology in long-life system design. Our investigation and analysis shows that many of the TSN standards are in their evolution phase and may as a consequence be subject to different interpretations and implementations. Therefore, achieving a full capacity of using the TSN technology may not be possible, in particular when it comes to design of systems having an expected long life. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - In modern manufacturing systems, various industrial communication systems (e.g.,_eldbus systems and industrial Ethernet networks) have been used to realize reliable information exchange. However, these industrial communication solutions are largely incompatible with each other, which do not satisfy the new requirements of Industry 4.0. Recently Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has been developed to improve the real-time capabilities to the standard Ethernet, and is considered to be a promising realtime communication solution for Industry 4.0. In this work, we propose a communication architecture for a manufacturing system using the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and TSN technologies. TSN is adopted as the communication backbone to connect heterogeneous industrial automation subsystems. The OPC UA is adopted to realize horizontal and vertical communication between subsystems in thefield layer and the entities of the upper layers.We implement a laboratory-level manufacturing system to validate the proposed architecture. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and capability of the proposed architecture. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of a key TSN substandard, i.e., IEEE 802.1Qbv, in the laboratory-level manufacturing system. The evaluation results demonstrate that IEEE 802.1Qbv can indeed provide excellent real-time capabilities for industrial applications. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

AB  - Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) is a core mechanism to guarantee the deterministic transmission for periodic time-sensitive flows in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). The generic TAS requires complex configurations for the Gate Control List (GCL) attached to each queue in a switch. To simplify the design of a TSN switch, a Ping-Pong queue-based model named Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) was proposed in IEEE 802.1 Qch by assigning fixed configurations to TAS. However, IEEE 802.1 Qch only defines the queue model and workflow of CQF. A global planning mechanism which maps the time-sensitive flows onto the underlying resources both temporally and spatially is urgently needed to make CQF practical.In this paper, we propose an Injection Time Planning (ITP) mechanism to optimize the network throughput of time-sensitive flows based on the observation that the start time when the packets are injected into the network has an important influence on the utilization of CQF queue resources. ITP provides a global temporal and spatial resource abstraction to make the implementation details transparent to algorithm designers. Based on our ITP mechanism, a novel heuristic algorithm named Tabu-ITP with domain-specific optimizing strategies is designed and evaluated under three typical network topologies in industrial control scenarios. Compared with the Naive algorithm without using ITP mechanism, experimental results demonstrate that Tabu-ITP improves the mapped flow number by 10x and the resource utilization by 65%. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - System integration has became more challenging than ever. In this poster, we propose to use a formal approach to verify the Quality of Service (QoS) compatibility of components connected by the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) [6]. We demonstrate that the formal approach, if realized, is applicable to various stages including specification definition of components to be developed, integration with existing components, runtime monitoring with adaptive components, and maintenance of components. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents the first holistic modeling approach for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) communication that integrates into a model-and component-based software development framework for distributed embedded systems. Based on these new models, we also present an end-to-end timing model for TSN-interconnected distributed embedded systems. Our approach is expressive enough to model the timing information of TSN and the timing behaviour of software that communicates over TSN, hence allowing end-to-end timing analysis. A proof of concept for the proposed approach is provided by implementing it for a component model and tool suite used in the vehicle industry. Moreover, a use case from the vehicle industry is modeled and analyzed with the proposed approach to demonstrate its usability. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Safety is traditionally the most relevant property for automotive systems, and it is further enhanced by Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in modern automotive systems. To support ADAS and other advanced autonomous functions, automotive electronic systems become more distributed and connected than ever, with in-vehicle architecture or Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication. These connections create a variety of interfaces which become breeding grounds for security attacks. Accordingly, security becomes a rising issue for automotive systems. In this paper, we address safety and security together, especially their interactions, in Ethernet-based automotive networks which are believed to be the next-generation automotive networks since they are able to provide high bandwidths, certain timing guarantees, and well-developed technologies. We discuss the interactions between safety and security in three problems: secret key management, frame replication and elimination, and Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) segmentation. We demonstrate that safety and security can work together, but sometimes there is a trade-off between them. This indicates that safety cannot stand alone without considering security, and network security is a necessary component of system security. Towards safer and securer automotive systems, safety and security should be considered together during design stages of automotive systems. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - Ethernet-AVB/TSN (Audio Video Bridging/Time-Sensitive Networking) and AFDX (Avionics Full DupleX switched Ethernet) are switched Ethernet technologies, which are both candidates for real-time communication in the context of transportation systems. AFDX implements a fixed priority scheduling strategy with two priority levels. Ethernet-AVB/TSN supports a similar fixed priority scheduling with an additional Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) mechanism. Besides, TSN can support time-triggered scheduling strategy. One direct effect of CBS mechanism is to increase the delay of its flows while decreasing the delay of other priority ones. The former effect can be seen as the shaping restriction and the latter effect can be seen as the shaping benefit from CBS. The goal of this paper is to investigate the impact of CBS on different priority flows, especially on the intermediate priority ones, as well as the effect of CBS bandwidth allocation. It is based on a performance comparison of AVB/TSN and AFDX by simulation in an automotive case study. Furthermore, the shaping benefit is modeled based on integral operation from network calculus perspective. Combing with the analysis of shaping restriction and shaping benefit, some configuration suggestions on the setting of CBS bandwidth are given. Results show that the effect of CBS depends on flow loads and CBS configurations. A larger load of high priority flows in AVB tends to a better performance for the intermediate priority flows when compared with AFDX. Shaping benefit can be explained and calculated according to the changing from the permitted maximum burst. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The enhancements being developed by the Time-Sensitive Networking Task Group as part of IEEE 802.1 emerge as the future of real-time communication over Ethernet net- works for automotive and industrial application domains. In particular IEEE 802.1Qbv is key to enabling timeliness guarantees via so-called time-aware shapers. In this paper, we address the computation of fully deterministic schedules for 802.1Qbv-compliant multi-hop switched networks. We identify and analyze key functional parameters affecting the deterministic behaviour of real-time communication under 802.1Qbv and, based on a generalized configuration of these parameters, derive the required constraints for computing offline schedules guaranteeing low and bounded jitter and deterministic end-to-end latency for critical communication fiows. Furthermore, we discuss several optimization direc- tions and concrete configurations exposing trade-offs against the required computation time. We also show the perfor- mance of our approach via synthetic network workloads on top of different network configurations. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - New hard real-time Advanced Driver Assistance Systems such as the Collision-Avoidance System push the bandwidth requirements of the communication infrastructure to a new level. Controller Area Network (CAN) and FlexRay are reaching their limits. Ethernet-based automotive networks such as Ethernet AVB are capable of addressing these requirements. However, designing predictable Ethernet networks is more complex than the design of a traditional CAN bus. Formal real-time performance characteristics are key to a successful Ethernet integration. In this paper we present an improved Ethernet AVB performance analysis which exploits traffic-stream correlations. The results are significantly tighter compared to related work. Copyright 2014 ACM.

AB  - We examine the impact of multiple primary receivers on cognitive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay networks with underlay spectrum sharing. For such a network, we propose transmit antenna selection with receive maximal-ratio combining (TAS/MRC) as an interference-aware design to satisfy the power constraints in the primary and secondary networks. To demonstrate this, we derive new closed-form expressions for the exact and asymptotic outage probability with TAS/MRC and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying over independent Nakagami-m fading channels in the primary and secondary networks. Several important design insights are reached. We find that the TAS/MRC strategy achieves a full diversity gain when the transmit power in the secondary network is proportional to the peak interference power in the primary network. Furthermore, we highlight that the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of TAS/MRC is independent of the primary network and entirely dependent on the secondary network. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - We define a novel core network router scheduling architecture to carry and isolate time constrained and elastic traffic flows from best-effort traffic. To date, one possible solution has been to implement a core DiffServ network with standard fair queuing and scheduling mechanisms as proposed in the well-known ''A Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) for Capacity-Admitted Traffic'''' from RFC5865. This architecture is one of the most selected solutions by internet service provider for access networks (e.g. Customer-Premises Equipment or satellite PEP). In this study, we argue that the proposed standard implementation does not allow to efficiently quantify the reserved capacity for the AF class. By using a novel credit based shaper mechanism called Burst Limiting Shaper, we show that we can provide the same isolation for the time constrained EF class while better quantifying the part allocated to the AF class. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The existing in-vehicle networks are not capable of accommodating increased data in vehicle and the demand of bandwidth. Next generation networks require higher bandwidth and shorter latency. Therefore, inexpensive and high bandwidth ethernet have be studied. IEEE802.1 Audio Video Bridging (AVB) is the standard used to transmit Audio and Video streaming data with guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). AVB can reserve network resources using IEEE 802.1 Qat protocol with low latency and periodic messages using traffic shaping. In addition, it can transmit streaming data with Credit based Shaping (CBS) algorithms. In this paper, we analyzed CBS algorithms. In addition, we measured the worst case in embedded system. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Possible evolution of Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) are currently investigated. Such network should support existing time-constrained avionics flows, as well as new best effort traffic, requiring scheduling algorithms to meet guarantees on avionics flows. Following the current trend of the automotive industry to move toward Audio/Video Bridging (AVB), this paper evaluates an application of the scheduling scheme described in the emerging IEEE 802.1 AVB standard in an avionics switched Ethernet scenario. Results are compared to other common scheduling strategies such as strict priority queuing, and different fair scheduling variants. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Audio Video Bridging (AVB) switched Ethernet is being considered as a promising network alternative solution for the automotive industry thanks to its high data transmission rate and dedicated bandwidth for real-time traffic. However, guaranteeing deterministic communications of an AVB switched Ethernet network remains a key issue for safety-critical applications in automotive domain. In order to ensure real-time timeliness constraints for any flow sent in AVB switched Ethernet networks, we establish new bounds on the worst-case end-to-end delay of any flow. Our contributions are the following: (i) We first develop a worst-case delay analysis in the context of AVB switched Ethernet network based on an extension of the Trajectory Approach. (ii) Then we take into account serialization constraints on frame transmissions to improve the computation of worst-case end-to-end delay bounds. (iii) Finally, we refine the proposed approach by taking into consideration the AVB traffic shaping characteristics. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated on a set of representative automotive examples. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Schedulability analysis is one of the most important issues in developing and analyzing real-time systems. Given a task system where each task is characterized by a worst-case execution time (WCET) and a relative deadline, the schedulability analysis is decidable. However in reality, it is difficult to calculate the WCET of a complex task, even after it is abstracted to a formal model, e.g., timed automata (TAs). This paper proposes a schedulability analysis method without the information of the WCET, by introducing a model named timed regular task automata (TRTAs). Each task is described by a TA, a starting point with a clock valuation, a status and a relative deadline. A test is performed on each TA for an under-approximation of the WCET. The system may still be unschedulable under the approximation. A further schedulability checking is then performed by encoding to the reachability problem of nested timed automata (NeTAs). The methodology is thus sound and complete. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB  - The IEEE Audio Video Bridging (AVB) technology is nowadays under consideration in several automation domains, such as, automotive, avionics, and industrial communications. AVB offers several benefits, such as open specifications, the existence of multiple providers of electronic components, and the real-time support, as AVB provides bounded latency to real-time traffic classes. In addition to the above mentioned properties, in the automotive domain, comparing with the existing in-vehicle networks, AVB offers significant advantages in terms of high bandwidth, significant reduction of cabling costs, thickness and weight, while meeting the challenging EMC/EMI requirements. Recently, an improvement of the AVB protocol, called the AVB ST, was proposed in the literature, which allows for supporting scheduled traffic, i.e., a class of time-sensitive traffic that requires time-driven transmission and low latency. In this paper, we present a schedulability analysis for the real-time traffic crossing through the AVB ST network. In addition, we formally prove that, if the bandwidth in the network is allocated according to the AVB standard, the schedulability test based on response time analysis will fail for most cases even if, in reality, these cases are schedulable. In order to provide guarantees based on analysis test a bandwidth over-reservation is required. In this paper, we propose a solution to obtain a minimized bandwidth over-reservation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to formally spot the limitation and to propose a solution for overcoming it. The proposed analysis is applied to both the AVB standard and the AVB ST. The analysis results are compared with the results of several simulative assessments, obtained using OMNeT++, on both automotive and industrial case studies. The comparison between the results of the analysis and the simulation ones shows the effectiveness of the analysis proposed in this work. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Transmit antenna selection (TAS) schemes have been adopted in various communication systems to provide improved performance with relatively reduced complexity. The quality-of-service (QoS) in these systems depends on the availability of perfect channel state information (CSI). In practice, it is difficult to acquire perfect CSI, since it may get outdated due to feedback process. In this paper, we investigate the impact of outdated CSI in a TAS system that operates in a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication environment. The V2V channel is modeled by the double-Weibull (DW) distribution, a widely adopted distribution for modelling scenarios where both the transmitter and the receiver are in motion. In this context, we introduce and derive important statistical metrics for the bivariate DW distribution, such as the probability density function, the cumulative distribution function, and the moments. Based on them, exact expressions for the outage probability and the average bit error probability of the TAS scheme are derived under the assumption of outdated CSI. Moreover, simplified asymptotic closed-form expressions have been obtained. These expressions are then used to study the performance of the system under consideration. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - To cope with requirements for low latency, the upcoming Ethernet standard Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) provides enhancements for scheduled traffic, enabling mixed-criticality networks where critical messages are sent according to a system-wide schedule. While these networks provide a completely predictable behavior of the scheduled traffic by construction, timing analysis of the critical non-scheduled traffic with hard deadlines remains an unsolved issue. State-of-the-art analysis approaches consider the interference that unscheduled messages impose on each other, but there is currently no approach to determine the worst-case interference that can be imposed by scheduled traffic, the so-called schedule interference (SI), without relying on restrictions of the shape of the schedule. Considering all possible interference scenarios during each calculation of the SI is impractical, as it results in an explosion of the computation time. As a remedy, this paper proposes a) an approach to integrate the analysis of the worst-case SI into state-of-the-art timing analysis approaches and b) preprocessing techniques that reduce the computation time of the SI-calculation by several orders of magnitude without introducing any pessimism. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The embedded avionics system is a typical mission-critical and safety-critical system, and should ensure fulfillment of all constraints for all flows with individual timing requirements transmitted in networks. Scheduling strategies are used to meet this requirement, and different networking solutions have different approaches. AFDX (Avionics Full-DupleX Switched Ethernet) implements a SPQ (Strict Priority Queuing) scheduling strategy with two priority levels where large flow bursts from high priority data would lead to high delays for low priority flows. Ethernet-AVB (Audio Video Bridging) implements Credit-Based Shapers (CBS) on top of the SPQ mechanism, which can partly mitigate this problem. This kind of scheduling strategy could be considered in an avionics context for mix-criticality systems. In this paper, CBS and SPQ scheduling algorithms are compared especially from the worst-case criteria by using network calculus approach. Results show that compared with SPQ, CBS has a better anti-interference ability, though it would bring a bigger delay even from the worst-case prospective. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In the high-tech and automotive industry, bandwidth considerations and widely accepted standardization are two important reasons why Ethernet is currently being considered as an alternative solution for real-time communication (compared to the traditional fieldbusses). Although Ethernet was originally not intended for this purpose, the development of the Ethernet AVB standard enables its use for transporting high-volume data (e.g. from cameras and entertainment applications) with latency guarantees. The traditional busy-period analysis that ensures these latency guarantees relies on knowledge of all data streams, including interference. However, for complex industrial systems, the assumption that characteristics of all interfering data streams are known, is not realistic. As the amount of components connected to an Ethernet network grows, it becomes less likely that one can know or enforce the traffic patterns generated by all these components. In this paper, we present an independent real-time analysis based on so-called eligible intervals, which does not rely on any assumptions on interfering priority classes other than those enforced in the Ethernet AVB standard. We prove our analysis is tight when no additional information on interference is known. Furthermore, we compare the results of our approach to the two most recent busy-period analyses, point out sources of pessimism in these earlier works, and discuss the advantages of using eligible-intervals over busy-period analysis when studying idling servers. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - Advanced training of healthcare professionals active in organ donation is highlighted as a major means to overcome organ shortage. The objective of this study was to improve donation rates in the selected European target areas (TAs) by providing an advanced training program. A prospective intervention study was conducted in 25 TAs with active donor programs from 17 European countries, between 2007 and 2009. A training program based on collaborative methodology was designed at three different professional levels (health workers awareness, junior transplant coordinators, managers). Courses evaluation scores and donation figures in each TA were collected and compared before and after intervention. Courses with new developed training tools were implemented reaching out 3286 healthcare professionals. Feed-back questionnaires revealed a high degree of satisfaction among participants (average of 4.35 on a 1-5 scale). The number of utilized donors in the TAs increased from 15.7 ± 14.3 (95% CI: 9.8-21.6) to 20.0 ± 17.1 (95% CI: 13-27.1) (P = 0.014) and the number of organs recovered increased from 49.7 ± 48.5 (95% CI: 29.6-69.7) to 59.3 ± 52.1 (95% CI: 37.8-80.8) (P = 0.044). The European Training Program on Organ Donation is a successful training program, achieving a significant increase in organ donation figures. © 2012 The Authors Transplant International © 2012 European Society for Organ Transplantation.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is becoming more important in automotive and industrial sectors. There is no clear strategy how to use TSN to improve and migrate the established real-time protocols without excluding legacy devices. This paper presents a realistic concept to integrate TSN into automation networks. We choose Sercos as a deterministic Industrial-Ethernet protocol to be extended with the TSN Standards IEEE 802.1ASRev and IEEE 802.1Qbv. By simulating the Sercos over TSN network, we investigate the impact of integrating a TSN-capable switch in a Sercos network to enable a topology extension from line/ring to star/tree. By comparing the impact of: increasing the data rate and topology extension, we demonstrate the improvement of Industrial-Ethernet timing performance. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Building Wireless Sensor Networks: Application to Routing and Data Diffusion discusses challenges involved in securing routing in wireless sensor networks with new hybrid topologies. An analysis of the security of real time data diffusion-a protocol for routing in wireless sensor networks-is provided, along with various possible attacks and possible countermeasures. Different applications are introduced, and new topologies are developed. Topics include audio video bridging (AVB) switched Ethernet, which uses the representation of a network of wireless sensors by a grayscale image to construct routing protocols, thereby minimizing energy consumption and data sharing in vehicular ad-hoc networks. Existing wireless networks aim to provide communication services between vehicles by enabling the vehicular networks to support wide range applications. New topologies are proposed first, based on the graphiton models, then the wireless sensor networks (WSN) based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard (ZigBee sensors, and finally the Pancake graphs as an alternative to the Hypercube for interconnecting processors in parallel computer networks. © ISTE Press Ltd 2017.

AB  - Ethernet is going to play a major role in automotive communications,                         thus representing a significant paradigm shift in automotive networking.                         Ethernet technology will allow for multiple in-vehicle systems (such as,                         multimedia/infotainment, camera-based advanced driver assistance and                         on-board diagnostics) to simultaneously access information over a single                         unshielded twisted pair cable. The leading technology for automotive                         applications is the IEEE Audio Video Bridging (AVB), which offers several                         advantages, such as open specification, multiple sources of electronic                         components, high bandwidth, the compliance with the challenging EMC/EMI                         automotive requirements, and significant savings on cabling costs, thickness                         and weight. This paper surveys the state of the art on Ethernet-based                         automotive communications and especially on the IEEE AVB, with a particular                         focus on the way to provide support to the so-called scheduled traffic, that                         is a class of time-sensitive traffic (e.g., control traffic) that is                         transmitted according to a time schedule. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (VWD) is difficult due to the wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes associated with this disorder. We have analysed and characterized haemostatic function in VWD patients using a microchip-based flow chamber system. Microchips coated with either collagen [platelet (PL)-chip] or collagen/thromboplastin [atherome (AR)-chip] were used to evaluate platelet thrombus formation at 1000 s-1 and fibrin-rich platelet thrombus formation at 240 s-1 respectively. Blood samples from an asymptomatic patient with VWD type 1 [von Willebrand factor (VWF): RCo 3.2%; bleeding score (BS 2] displayed normal thrombus formation in both PL- and AR-chips, whereas blood from a symptomatic type 1 patient (VWF: RCo 14%, BS 9) had significantly delayed capillary occlusion. Nearly complete suppression of the flow pressure increase was observed in symptomatic patients with VWD type 2A (BS 13) and 2N (BS 27), whereas no flow pressure was found for the type 3 patient (BS 6). Fibrin-rich platelet thrombus formation was only weakly increased by the in vitro addition of factor VIII (FVIII) to blood samples from the type 3 patient, but was normalized by the addition of VWF/FVIII. The in vivo effects of treatment with desmopressin or VWF/FVIII for the symptomatic patients were analysed using two types of microchips. The PL-chip was highly sensitive for patients' VWF-mediated platelet functions, whereas the AR-chip allowed assessment of overall haemostatic ability, including sensitivity to both VWF and FVIII. The combined analysis with PL- and AR-chips may be potentially useful for the diagnosis of VWD based on clinical phenotypes, and for monitoring drug effects. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Twitter provides a public streaming API that is strictly limited, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve good coverage and relevance when monitoring tweets for a specific topic of interest. In this paper, we address the tweet acquisition challenge to enhance monitoring of tweets based on the client/application needs in an online adaptive manner such that the quality and quantity of the results improves over time. We propose a Tweet Acquisition System (TAS), that iteratively selects phrases to track based on an explore-exploit strategy. Our experimental studies show that TAS significantly improves recall of relevant tweets and the performance improves when the topics are more specific. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - Communication requirements in automotive electronics are steadily increasing. To satisfy this demand and enable future automotive embedded architectures, new interconnect technologies are needed. Audio Video Bridging (AVB) Ethernet is a promising candidate to accomplish this as it features time-sensitive and synchronous communication in combination with high bit rates. However, there is a lack of commercial products as well as research regarding AVB-capable system-on-chips (SoCs). In this paper, we investigate how and at what cost a legacy Ethernet MAC can be enhanced into an AVB Ethernet controller. Using FPGA prototyping and a real system based on an ARM Cortex-A9 SoC running Linux, we conducted a series of experiments to evaluate important performance metrics and to validate our design decisions. We achieved frame release latencies of less than 6 μs and time-synchronization with an endpoint-induced inaccuracy of up to 8 μs. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The tool Imitator implements the Inverse Method (IM) for Timed Automata (TAs). Given a TA and a tuple π 0 of reference valuations for timings, IM synthesizes a constraint around π 0 where behaves in the same discrete manner. This provides us with a quantitative measure of robustness of the behavior of around π 0. The new version Imitator 2.5 integrates the new features of stopwatches (in addition to standard clocks) and updates (in addition to standard clock resets), as well as powerful algorithmic improvements for state space reduction. These new features make the tool well-suited to analyze the robustness of solutions in several classes of preemptive scheduling problems. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Increasing number of in-vehicle sensors, actuators and controllers involved in novel applications such as autonomous driving, requires new communication technologies to fulfill heterogeneous non-functional requirements such as latency, bandwidth and reliability. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of new standards in development by Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) defined to support mixed criticality based on Ethernet technology. This technology has recently raised significant attention of automotive domain. However, the mutual influence of application requirements in relation to TSN standards still remains a complex problem to master. For instance, considering an existing complex automotive network, an engineer has to carefully analyze the possible effects of adding new sensors on other existing critical applications. The network has to be configured such that the fulfilling of all requirements is verified. Targeting this problem, a modeling approach based on Logic Programming (LP) is developed to support more efficient configuration and verification process with focus on in-vehicle TSN networks. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - One of the key challenges in future Ethernet-based automotive and industrial networks is the low-latency transport of time-critical data. To date, Ethernet frames are sent non-preemptively. This introduces a major source of delay, as, in the worst-case, a latency-critical frame might be blocked by a frame of lower priority, which started transmission just before the latency-critical frame. The upcoming IEEE 802.3br standard will introduce Ethernet frame preemption to address this problem. While high-priority traffic benefits from preemption, lower-priority (yet still latency-sensitive) traffic experiences a certain overhead, impacting its timing behavior. In this paper, we present a formal timing analysis for Ethernet to derive worst-case latency bounds under preemption. We use a realistic automotive Ethernet setup to analyze the worst-case performance of standard Ethernet and Ethernet TSN under preemption and also compare our results to non-preemptive implementations of these standards. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Busy period analysis is often used as a basis for worst-case response time analysis of priority based systems. However, when shaping strategies are used to prevent starvation of lower priorities, it becomes difficult to achieve tightness results using this method. The reason for this is that a busy period is defined as the longest interval in which there exists pending load. It is exclusively based on execution time, and does not take the amount of provided bandwidth into account. As a consequence, it is less suitable for the study of idling systems. In particular, we do not yet have tightness results regarding the analysis of the Ethernet AVB standard, in which credit-based shaping is applied. In this paper, we propose an alternative to the use of busy periods. We show that, by defining an eligible interval in such a way that provisioning is taken into account, tight worst-case response time bounds can more easily be obtained for Ethernet AVB, at least in the case of either lower-or higher-priority interference. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Vehicle communication networks are challenged by increasing demands for bandwidth, safety, and security. New data is coming into the vehicle from personal devices (e.g. mobile phones), infotainment systems, camera-based driver assistance, and wireless communication with other vehicles and infrastructure. Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) provides high levels of bandwidth and security, making it a potential solution to the challenges of vehicle communication networks. However, in order to be used in control applications, Ethernet must provide known timing performance (e.g. bounded latency and jitter), and in some cases redundancy. This paper explores use of Ethernet for in-vehicle control applications. It begins by providing an overview of four Ethernet-based protocols under consideration for in-vehicle control: Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX), Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet), Ethernet for Control Automation Technology (EtherCAT), and standard Ethernet (IEEE 802.1 including Audio Video Bridging). The paper continues with discussion of key topics related to use of these Ethernet protocols for in-vehicle control. The topics include cost, physical layer, topology, startup time, redundancy, time-triggered scheduling, security, gateways, and higher layer software (e.g. AUTOSAR). Given the real-time nature of the application domain, the paper devotes a section to latency analysis (for communication based on the Ethernet protocols), which computes the worst-case transmission time for control data from source to destination(s).

AB  - Software defined networking (SDN) aims to standardize the control and configuration of network infrastructure. It consolidates network control by moving the network's control plane to a (logically) centralized controller and downgrading switches to simple forwarding devices. This offers huge advantages for future automotive Ethernet networks, including admission control (e.g. to prevent/limit congestion) or network reconfiguration (e.g. in case of faults), both based on a centralized view of the current network state. SDN's centralized architecture, however, requires additional communication, which entails a certain overhead. If SDN is used in safety-critical real-time networks, this communication is subject to strict timing requirements. In this paper, we present a formal analysis based evaluation of the general suitability of SDN for time-sensitive networks including overhead, scalability, and timing guarantees by using a realistic automotive setup. © 2016 EDAA.

AB  - This paper is the result of a study realized by Thales Alenia Space (TAS) in collaboration with the french space agency (CNES). It introduces an approach for parallelizing a payloadoriented software application. The first part of the paper tackles with the different issues a software engineer faces when he/she starts a software development on a multicore platform. The second part exposes, through a concrete case of study, the iterative approach we adopt to distribute a payload-oriented software application. The case of study consists in parallelizing a full software signal processing chain running on top of an Execution Platform composed of a PikeOS hypervisor and of an ARM quad-core platform (Cortex A9). Finally, the conclusion of the paper focuses on returns of experience related to such a development.

AB  - Due to ever-increasing bandwidth requirements of modern automotive applications, Ethernet AVB is becoming a standard high-speed bus in automotive E/E architectures. Since Ethernet AVB is tailored to audio and video entertainment, existing analysis approaches neglect the specific requirements and features of heterogeneous E/E architectures and their applications. This paper presents a timing analysis technique based on Real Time Calculus to consider Ethernet AVB in complex E/E architectures, reflecting key features such as static routing and stream reservation, fixed topology, and real-time applications. A comparison with a simulation on case studies from the automotive domain gives evidence that the proposed technique delivers valuable bounds for complete sensor-to-actuator chains, enabling automatic system synthesis and design space exploration approaches. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - A time sensitive converged network that can aggregate fronthaul and machine-to-machine (M2M) streams is required for the fifth generation mobile communication system (5G) era. Recently, a time sensitive network (TSN) for fronthaul in IEEE 802.1CM has been attracting attention. A time aware shaper (TAS), which is a component technology of a TSN, is an effective way to realize a converged network. However, lower priority streams suffer from a lack of usable bandwidth and a huge latency when employing a TAS because the broad bandwidth is reserved for high priority streams in TAS schemes. In this paper, we propose a gate shrunk (GS-)TAS, where a GS-frame is added at the end of high priority streams. We evaluate bandwidth use efficiency by using a numerical simulation. We also simulate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the latency performance in a bridged node. We report that the latency reduction rate for the M2M stream is 55.2% for a CDF of 99.7%. In addition, the GS-TAS use does not affect the fronthaul streams. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Ethernet is increasingly recognized as the future communication standard for distributed embedded systems in multiple domains such as industrial automation, automotive and avionics. A main motivation for this is cost and available data rate. A critical issue in the adoption of Ethernet in these domains is the timing of frame transfers, as many relevant applications require a guaranteed low-latency communication in order to meet real-time constraints. Ethernet AVB is an upcoming standard which addresses the timing issues by extending the existing strict-priority arbitration. Still, it needs to be evaluated whether these mechanism suffice for the targeted applications. For safety-critical applications, this can not only be done using intuition or simulation but requires a formal approach to assure the coverage of all worst-case corner cases. Hence, we present in this paper a formal worst-case analysis of the timing properties of Ethernet AVB and strict-priority Ethernet. This analysis mathematically determines safe upper bounds on the latency of frame transfers. Using this approach, we evaluate different topologies for a typical use-case in industrial automation. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Predictable and low-latency communication timing is one of the major challenges for employing Ethernet-based networks in industrial automation. The evolving Ethernet AVB standard appears to be a promising architecture, as it provides mechanisms for predictable timing with standard Ethernet hardware. However, the worst-case timing of Ethernet AVB still has to be evaluated. In this paper, we analyze the timing of Ethernet AVB using both simulation and a formal worst-case analysis based on Compositional Performance Analysis known from embedded computing systems. We investigate two industrial scenarios, a typical line topology and a more complex two-level network, and compare the results from analysis and simulation. This allows us get a good indication of the applicability of the current Ethernet AVB with respect to predictable low-latency timing in industrial automation networks. We also gain an understanding of the benefits and limitations of formal Compositional Performance Analysis compared to simulation in this context. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Increasingly, Ethernet is being used in automotive as a vehicle network backbone. It is ideal for service-oriented communications; streamed communications, such as Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) [1]; and Diagnostics over Internet Protocol (DoIP) [2] communications - areas in which high-bandwidth and reliable performance are essential. Designers are accustomed to network communication systems CAN, LIN, and FlexRay, but how will the timing performance be verified in an Ethernet network? This paper looks at network-wide timing analysis challenges where a mixture of CAN, FlexRay, and Ethernetbased busses co-exist. It is also worth noting that the AUTOSAR standard [3] supports timing definition for all elements in a mixed topology network, but again, accounting for the many different timing paths is a non-trivial process. Figure 1The Ethernet backbone serving different domains. Due to features are distributed in the vehicle, the communication need is typically tightly related to the feature complexity. Also different features have also requirements of isolation from other features, for example infotainment communication may need to be isolated from dynamic chassis control. One efficient way to design the topology in the vehicle is to have a backbone with different domain sub-networks (Figure 1). This allows the designer to isolate different domains and keep control over the communication. © 2016 SAE International.

AB  - In this paper we discuss the challenges that are faced when the state-of-the-art research results are transferred to a model-based tool chain for the industrial use. These challenges are often overlooked when the research results are implemented in an academic environment. In particular, we discuss various challenges regarding the implementation and integration of the response-time analysis for heterogeneous networks, comprising of CAN and Ethernet AVB, as a plug-in for the Rubus Analysis Framework. Rubus tool suite is used for the model- and component-based development of software for vehicular real-time systems by several international companies. We also discuss preliminary solutions to deal with the challenges. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Vehicle communication networks are challenged by increasing demands for bandwidth, safety, and security. New data is coming into the vehicle from personal devices (e.g. mobile phones), infotainment systems, camera-based driver assistance, and wireless communication with other vehicles and infrastructure. Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) provides high levels of bandwidth and security, making it a potential solution to the challenges of vehicle communication networks. However, in order to be used in control applications, Ethernet must provide known timing performance (e.g. bounded latency and jitter), and in some cases redundancy. This paper explores use of Ethernet for in-vehicle control applications. It begins by providing an overview of four Ethernet-based protocols under consideration for in-vehicle control: Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX), Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet), Ethernet for Control Automation Technology (EtherCAT), and standard Ethernet (IEEE 802.1 including Audio Video Bridging). The paper continues with discussion of key topics related to use of these Ethernet protocols for in-vehicle control. The topics include cost, physical layer, topology, startup time, redundancy, time-triggered scheduling, security, gateways, and higher layer software (e.g. AUTOSAR). Given the real-time nature of the application domain, the paper devotes a section to latency analysis (for communication based on the Ethernet protocols), which computes the worst-case transmission time for control data from source to destination(s). © 2012 SAE International.

AB  - β-cells in the pancreatic islet respond to elevated plasma glucose by secreting insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis. In addition to glucose stimulation, insulin secretion is modulated by numerous G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The GPCR ligands Kisspeptin-10 (KP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) potentiate insulin secretion through Gq and Gscoupled receptors, respectively. Despite many studies, the signaling mechanisms by which KP and GLP-1 potentiate insulin release are not thoroughly understood. We investigated the downstream signaling pathways of these ligands and their affects on cellular redox potential, intracellular calcium activity ([Ca2+]i ), and insulin secretion from b-cells within intact murine islets. In contrast to previous studies performed on single b-cells, neither KP nor GLP-1 affect [Ca2 +] i upon stimulation with glucose. KP significantly increases the cellular redox potential, while no effect is observed with GLP-1, suggesting that KP and GLP-1 potentiate insulin secretion through different mechanisms. Co-treatment with KP and the Gbc-subunit inhibitor gallein inhibits insulin secretion similar to that observed with gallein alone, while co-treatment with gallein and GLP-1 does not differ from GLP-1 alone. In contrast, co-treatment with the Gbc activator mSIRK and either KP or GLP-1 stimulates insulin release similar to mSIRK alone. Neither gallein nor mSIRK alter [Ca2+]i activity in the presence of KP or GLP-1. These data suggest that KP likely alters insulin secretion through a Gbc-dependent process that stimulates glucose metabolism without altering Ca2 + activity, while GLP-1 does so, at least partly, through a Ga-dependent pathway that is independent of both metabolism and Ca2+.  Experiments were performed in part through use of the Vanderbilt University Cell Imaging Shared Resource (supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants P30DK020593, P30DK058404, and U24DK059637).

AB  - Switched Ethernet has been proposed as network technology for automotive and industrial applications. IEEE AVB is a collection of standards that specifies (among other elements) a set of network traffic shaping mechanisms (i.e., rules to regulate the traffic flow) to have guaranteed Quality of Service for Audio/Video traffic. However, in-vehicle control applications like advanced driver-assistance systems require much lower latencies than provided by this standard. Within the context of IEEE TSN (Time Sensitive Networking), three new traffic shaping mechanisms are considered, named Burst Limiting, Time Aware and Peristaltic shaper respectively. In this paper we explain and compare these shapers, we examine their worst case end-to-end latencies analytically and we investigate their behavior through a simulation of a particular setup. We show that the shapers hardly satisfy the requirements for 100Mbps Ethernet, but can come close under further restrictions. We also show the impact the shapers have on AVB traffic. © 2015 EDAA.

AB  - Ethernet is considered as a future communication standard for distributed embedded systems in the automotive and industrial domains. A key challenge is the deterministic low-latency transport of Ethernet frames, as many safety-critical real-time applications in these domains have tight timing requirements. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an upcoming set of Ethernet standards, which (among other things) address these requirements by specifying new quality of service mechanisms in the form of different traffic shapers. In this paper, we consider TSN's time-aware and peristaltic shapers and evaluate whether these shapers are able to fulfill these strict timing requirements. We present a formal timing analysis, which is a key requirement for the adoption of Ethernet in safety-critical real-time systems, to derive worst-case latency bounds for each shaper. We use a realistic automotive Ethernet setup to compare these shapers to each other and against Ethernet following IEEE 802.1Q. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Future autonomous vehicles and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) need real-time audio and video transmission together with control data traffic (CDT). Audio/video stream delay analysis has been largely investigated in AVB (Audio Video Bridging) context, but not yet with the presence of the CDT in the new TSN context. In this paper we present a local delay analysis of AVB frames under hierarchical scheduling of credit-based shaping and time-aware shaping on TSN switches. We present the effects of time aware shaping on AVB traffic, how it changes the relative order of transmission of frames leading to bursts and worst case scenarios for lower priority streams. We also show that these bursts are upper-bounded by the Credit-Bases Shaper, hence the worst-case transmissions delay of a given stream is also upper-bounded. We present the analysis to compute the worst case delay for a frame, as well as the feasibility condition necessary for the analysis to be applied. Our methods (analysis and simulation) are applied to an automotive use case, which is defined within the Eurostars RETINA project, and where both control data traffic and AVB traffic must be guaranteed. © 2017 ACM.

AB  - We propose transmit antenna selection (TAS) in decode-and-forward (DF) relaying as an effective approach to reduce the interference in underlay spectrum sharing networks with multiple primary users (PUs) and multiple antennas at the secondary users (SUs). We compare two distinct protocols: 1) TAS with receiver maximal-ratio combining (TAS/MRC) and 2) TAS with receiver selection combining (TAS/SC). For each protocol, we derive new closed-form expressions for the exact and asymptotic outage probability with independent Nakagami-m fading in the primary and secondary networks. Our results are valid for two scenarios related to the maximum SU transmit power, i.e., P, and the peak PU interference temperature, i.e., Q{script}. When P is proportional to Q{script}, our results confirm that TAS/MRC and TAS/SC relaying achieve the same full diversity gain. As such, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) advantage of TAS/MRC relaying relative to TAS/SC relaying is characterized as a simple ratio of their respective SNR gains. When P is independent of Q{script}, we find that an outage floor is obtained in the large P regime where the SU transmit power is constrained by a fixed value of Q{script}. This outage floor is accurately characterized by our exact and asymptotic results. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Due to increasing bandwidth requirements, Ethernet technology is emerging in embedded systems application areas such as automotive, avionics, and industrial control. In the automotive domain, Ethernet enables integration of cameras, radars, and fusion to build active safety and automated driving systems. While Ethernet provides the necessary communication bandwidth, solutions are needed to satisfy stringent dependability and temporal requirements of such safety-critical systems. This paper introduces an asynchronous traffic scheduling algorithm, which gives low delay guarantees in a switched Ethernet network, while maintaining a low implementation complexity. We present a timing analysis and demonstrate the tightness of the delay bounds by extensive simulation experiments. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Upcoming high-bandwidth protocols like Ethernet TSN feature mechanisms for redundant and deterministic (scheduled) message delivery to integrate safety-and real-Time-critical applications and, thus, realize mixed-criticality systems. In existing design approaches, the message routing and system scheduling are generated in two entirely separated design steps, ignoring and/or not exploiting the distinct interrelations between routing and scheduling decisions. In this paper, we first introduce an exact approach to generate an implementation with a valid routing and a valid schedule in a single step by solving a 0-1 ILP. Second, we show that the 0-1 ILP formulation can be utilized in a design space exploration to optimize the routing and schedule with respect to, e.g., interference imposed on non-scheduled traffic or the number of configured port slots. We demonstrate the optimization potential of the proposed approach using a mixed-criticality system from the automotive domain. © 2017 ACM.

AB  - Real-time switched Ethernet communication is of increasing importance in many cyber-physical and embedded systems application areas such as automotive electronics, avionics, and industrial control. The IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group develops standards for real-time Ethernet, for example a time-triggered traffic class (IEEE 802.1Qbv-2015). New application areas, such as active safety and autonomous driving using radar, lidar, and camera sensors, which do not fall into the strictly periodic, time-triggered communication model, require a flexible traffic class that can accommodate various communication models while still providing hard real-time guarantees. In our previous work, we developed such a traffic class, Urgency-Based Scheduler (UBS), and its worst-case latency analysis. UBS is currently under standardization (P802.1Qcr) in the TSN task group. In this paper, we introduce and solve the UBS synthesis problem of assigning hard real-time data flows to queues and priorities to queues, the main parameters that determine communication latencies. The synthesis problem is particularly challenging due to the flexibility offered by UBS to aggregate flows and assign individual priority levels per network hop. We present an SMT approach, a cluster-based heuristic, and an extensive experimental evaluation. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Future in-vehicle networks will use Ethernet as their communication backbone. As many automotive applications are latency-sensitive and have strict real-time requirements, a key challenge in automotive network design is the deterministic low-latency transport of latency-critical Ethernet frames. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an upcoming set of Ethernet standards, which address these requirements by specifying new quality of service mechanisms in the form of different traffic shapers. One of these traffic shapers is the burst-limiting shaper (BLS). In this paper, we evaluate whether BLS is able to fulfill these strict timing requirements. We present a formal timing analysis for BLS in order to compute worst-case latency bounds. We use a realistic automotive Ethernet setup to compare BLS against Ethernet AVB and Ethernet following IEEE 802.1Q. © 2016 EDAA.

AB  - Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) is an available Ethernet-based standard designed as an affordable network for real-time multimedia streams. There are several studies trying to use this technology as the backbone of embedded real time systems. In the context of critical embedded systems, guarantees on the worst case delay (aka worst case traversal time, WCTT) must be provided. The network calculus is a theory designed to compute such bounds. This article gives a complete and accurate modelling of AVB in the network calculus framework. Copyright © 2014 ACM.

AB  - Recently, the mediation-aided approach is attracting more attention in Web service composition, in the meanwhile, temporal constraints are regarded as an important aspect to ensure the correctness and QoS in service compositions. This combination leads to a new challenge in analyzing the timed compatibility of mediation-aided service composition. Unfortunately, existing model checking based approaches are lack of the ability of transform mediation-aided service composition to Time Automata (TA) models, and suffer from state space explosion for large-scale and complex compositions. In this paper, we present a new model checking approach to analyzing timed compatibility. Firstly, mediation-aided service composition is automatically decomposed into fragments. Secondly, each fragment is transformed into a TA. Finally, the temporal constraints are checked by the queries of observing TAs. Compared with existing approaches, our approach is able to check timed compatibility of mediation-aided service composition, and is more efficient than them. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Platelet storage pool disease (SPD) is a platelet function disorder characterized by a reduction in the number or content of α-granules, dense granules, or both, and is diagnosed by specialized tests. Patients with SPD often present with prolonged bleeding time (BT), but the sensitivity and reproducibility of this test have limitations, often resulting in false negatives. It has recently been reported that an automated microchip flow-chamber system (T-TAS®) is useful in the assessment of anti-platelet therapy, and could have potential as a screening test for SPD. We examined the utility of T-TAS in three individuals from one family diagnosed with δ-SPD. The propositus had a mildly prolonged BT, and the standard tests for platelet function were close to the normal range. Whole blood samples were anti-coagulated with hirudin and applied to T-TAS microchips coated with collagen (PL-chips) at shear rates of 1000 and 2000 s−1. Platelet thrombus formation (PTF) was monitored with a pressure sensor. Markedly depressed PTF was observed in all cases at both shear rates. These findings indicate that T-TAS is highly sensitive to the defect in these patients with SPD, and may represent a good candidate screening test for a wide range of platelet function disorders. © 2015, The Japanese Society of Hematology.

AB  - Ethernet is an emerging technology in the automotive domain and is capable to overcome the bandwidth and scalability limits of traditional buses like CAN or FlexRay. Formal performance analysis methods are required to verify the timing, e.g. by providing upper bounds on end-to-end latencies, in safety-critical real-time systems, such as automotive control and advanced driver assistance systems. In many real-time capable Ethernet implementations such as IEEE 802.1Q or AVB, frames can be prioritized and frames of equal priority are scheduled in FIFO order at the switch ouput ports. In this paper, we show how to exploit Ethernet's FIFO scheduling in a compositional formal performance analysis to derive tighter timing guarantees. In an automotive Ethernet setup, our proposed analysis leads to a significant reduction in end-to-end latency guarantees. © 2015 ACM.

AB  - We propose transmit antenna selection with receive maximal-ratio combining (TAS/MRC) as an effective approach to reduce interference in cognitive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay networks. To demonstrate this, we derive new closed-form expressions for the exact and asymptotic outage probability of TAS/MRC with multiple antennas at the primary and secondary users. We consider underlay spectrum sharing where the secondary users (SUs) transmit in the presence of multiple primary users (PUs). We consider independent Nakagami-m fading in both the primary and secondary networks. Several important design insights are revealed. We find that TAS/MRC achieves a full diversity when the transmit power at the SUs is proportional to the peak interference power at the PUs. Furthermore, we highlight that this diversity gain is completely independent of the number of antennas at the PUs. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Background: The clinical phenotype of von Willebrand disease (VWD) is heterogeneous, and von Willebrand factor ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:RCo) does not always reflect clinical severity, especially in VWD type 1. We have reported the potential of a microchip flow-chamber system (Total-Thrombus Formation Analysis System [T-TAS®]) for assessing physiologic hemostasis in VWD. Aim: To evaluate the relationship between T-TAS, bleeding score (BS) and laboratory test results in type 1 VWD patients. Methods: Microchips coated with collagen (platelet chip [PL-chip]) or collagen/thromboplastin (AR-chip) were used to assess platelet thrombus formation (PTF) at high shear rates or fibrin-rich PTF at low shear rates, respectively, in whole blood from 50 patients. The times needed for the flow pressure to increase by 10 kPa and 30 kPa (T10 and T30) from baseline were calculated from flow pressure curves. BS was determined by the use of a standardized questionnaire. Results: PL-T10 values correlated with BS (R2 ~ 0.45) better than VWF:RCo (R2 ~ 0.36), irrespective of the flow rate, whereas AR-T10 showed only a weak correlation with BS (R2 ~0.18). Patients with PL-T10 > 10 min or AR-T10 > 30 min had lower VWF levels and higher BS than those with PL-T10 ≤ 10 min or AR-T10 ≤ 30 min, and the greatest differences were observed with PL-T10. Clinical severity appeared to correlate best with PL-T10 > 8 min. BS was significantly higher in patients with VWF:RCo of < 10 IU dL-1 than in those with VWF:RCo of 10 IU dL-1 to < 25 IU dL-1 and 25-40 IU dL-1. In patients with VWF:RCo of < 10 IU dL-1, BS was significantly higher in those with PL-T10 > 8 min than in those with PL-T10 ≤ 8 min. Conclusion: T-TAS could be a useful technique for discriminating and predicting BS in VWD type 1 patients. © 2016 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

AB  - Ethernet AVB is being actively considered by the automotive industry                         as a candidate for in-vehicle communication backbone. However, several                         questions pertaining to schedulability of hard real-time messages                         transmitted via such a switch remain unanswered. In this paper, we attempt                         to fill this void. We derive equations to perform worst-case response time                         analysis on Ethernet AVB switches by considering its credit-based shaping                         algorithm. Also, we propose several approaches to reduce the pessimism in                         the analysis to provide tighter bounds. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of new standards which is being developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers to support mixed-criticality requirements based on Ethernet technology. These standards have recently raised the attention of real-time domains such as automation and automotive. To support tight timing guarantees, Time-Aware Shaper (IEEE 802.1Qbv) is introduced based on the theory of time-triggered communication. However, the configuration of Time-Aware Shaper requires expertise and is a time consuming procedure. We aim to automate this procedure reducing configuration overhead. A novel graphical modeling is introduced which combines the strengths of model-based and logic programming modeling paradigms. Using the graphical editor, network topology, dataflow based on a publisher and subscriber concept, and the quality of service requirements are specified. Facts for a network knowledge base are automatically derived from the model. This knowledge base is used to generate constraints for schedule synthesis. These constraints are solved using a Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver to find a correct schedule. Moreover, we exploit the solver's capability of producing unsatisfiable cores and use it for network model correction. We annotated all generated schedule constraints and mapped them to the stream names to track the unsatisfiable streams from the solver's output. We gained insightful results showing that this information significantly helps to correct an unsatisfiable network model to find a feasible schedule. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Ethernet is a key technology to satisfy the communication requirements of future automotive embedded systems. Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) Ethernet is a set of IEEE standards that allows synchronous and time-sensitive communication. It is the favored candidate for backbone and camera applications, but is not expected to replace Controller Area Network (CAN). Instead, both have to coexist in future architectures. No research has been conducted regarding CAN to AVB gateways, and approaches for similar protocols are either not fit or inefficient. In this paper, we present a CAN to AVB Ethernet gateway that allows efficient, real-time capable forwarding. We aggregate and schedule multiple CAN frames into a single AVB Ethernet frame to minimize bandwidth requirements. We evaluate static and dynamic scheduling approaches and determine optimal gateway configurations, showing that the necessary bandwidth reservation is reduced by 72% compared to similar approaches. © 2015 EDAA.

AB  - Ethernet is attractive to a number of industrial domains, like the automotive and aviation sectors as well as the industrial control domain, due to the fact that it provides a good bandwidth with mass-market products that make it a low-cost solution. However, early models of Ethernet, such as Ethernet with CSMA/CD (carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection), introduce collisions and therefore cannot guarantee real-time performances, like deterministic delay, low jitter, etc. Switched Ethernet-based solutions eliminate collisions by employing full-duplex communication links. Although jitters can be introduced at switch output port buffers, several approaches have considered deterministic delay analyses that guarantee the real-time performance of such networks. Especially with new emergent technologies, like AVB, traffic shaping is employed in order to fulfill varying real-time requirements imposed by different data types and different flow classes. In the following sections, we discuss the application of switched Ethernet-based real-time solutions in different industrial domains including audio/video communications. © 2017 ISTE Press Ltd Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Industrial Internet and Industrial Internet of Things are emerging concepts that concern the use of Internet technologies on industrial environments. The main objective of such architectural visions is allowing a tight and seamless integration between all the functional units and layers that compose industrial processes, from the lowest levels (e.g. field-level devices such as sensors and actuators) to the higher layers, including management, logistics and maintenance. This kind of architecture promises, among other advantages, improving efficiency and flexibility, reduce installation and maintenance costs and reduce unplanned downtime. However, industrial processes often encompass functionalities like closed-loop control of physical processes that are highly critical and have strict timeliness requirements. These requirements are not satisfied by normal Ethernet-based systems. Standards such as IEEE AVB and TSN are addressing this problem, enhancing the real-time properties of Ethernet. However, considering the information presently available, such standards still present some limitations and inefficiencies. This paper reports the extension of HaRTES, an Ethernet-based real-time architecture originally developed for use at the lower layers of industrial scenarios, with MAC Bridge standard functionalities, to make it capable of being integrated on Industrial Internet of Things frameworks. The paper also presents preliminary results obtained with a prototype realization of the extended HaRTES switch. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - In the automotive industry, Ethernet is currently being introduced as a viable solution for real-time communication with high bandwidth requirements. In this paper, we present and prove a tight bound for the relative best-case response time of a frame in an Ethernet AVB switch compared to its response time in a schedule without interference. Our analysis is based on the observation that frames in a burst, scheduled using a credit shaping policy, may be scheduled earlier in case of interference than in a schedule without interference. We show how an upper bound on the build up of credit may be used to bound this relative speed-up of frames. © 2017 IEEE.
