TI  - Worst-Case Delay Bounds in Time-Sensitive Networks With Packet Replication and Elimination
T2  - IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING
M3  - Article
AB  - Packet replication and elimination functions are used by time-sensitive networks (as in the context of IEEE TSN and IETF DetNet) to increase the reliability of the network. Packets are replicated onto redundant paths by a replication function. Later the paths merge again and an elimination function removes the duplicates. This redundancy scheme has an effect on the timing behavior of time-sensitive networks and many challenges arise from conducting timing analyses. The replication can induce a burstiness increase along the paths of replicates, as well as packet mis-ordering that could increase the delays in the crossed bridges or routers. The induced packet mis-ordering could also negatively affect the interactions between the redundancy and scheduling mechanisms such as traffic regulators (as with per-flow regulator and interleaved regulator, implemented by TSN asynchronous traffic shaping). Using the network calculus framework, we provide a method of worst-case timing analysis for time-sensitive networks that implement redundancy mechanisms in the general use case, i.e., at end-devices and/or intermediate nodes. We first provide a network calculus toolbox for bounding the burstiness increase and the amount of reordering caused by the elimination function of duplicate packets. We then analyze the interactions with traffic regulators and show that their shaping-for-free property does not hold when placed after a packet elimination function. We provide a bound for the delay penalty when using per-flow regulators and prove that the penalty is not bounded with interleaved regulators. Finally, we use an industrial use-case to show the applicability and the benefits of our findings.

TI  - Worst-Case Delay Analysis of Time-Sensitive Networks With Deficit Round-Robin
T2  - IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In feed-forward time-sensitive networks with Deficit Round-Robin (DRR), worst-case delay bounds were obtained by combining Total Flow Analysis (TFA) with the strict service curve characterization of DRR by Tabatabaee et al. The latter is the best-known single server analysis of DRR, however the former is dominated by Polynomial-size Linear Programming (PLP), which improves the TFA bounds and stability region, but was never applied to DRR networks. We first perform the necessary adaptation of PLP to DRR by computing burstiness bounds per-class and per-output aggregate and by enabling PLP to support non-convex service curves. Second, we extend the methodology to support networks with cyclic dependencies: This raises further dependency loops, as, on one hand, DRR strict service curves rely on traffic characteristics inside the network, which comes as output of the network analysis, and on the other hand, TFA or PLP requires prior knowledge of the DRR service curves. This can be solved by iterative methods, however PLP itself requires making cuts, which imposes other levels of iteration, and it is not clear how to combine them. We propose a generic method, called PLP-DRR, for combining all the iterations sequentially or in parallel. We show that the obtained bounds are always valid even before convergence; furthermore, at convergence, the bounds are the same regardless of how the iterations are combined. This provides the best-known worst-case bounds for time-sensitive networks, with general topology, with DRR. We apply the method to an industrial network, where we find significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art.

CP  - 12th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design (ISCID)
CL  - Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Time-sensitive network (TSN) is regarded as the perspective communication network for the intelligent vehicle application because of its reserved bandwidths, QoS mechanisms, low transmission latency. The message scheduling in the TSN have an important influence on the reliability and safety of vehicles. In this paper, the TSN messages between the vehicular electronic control units are classified into the control data traffic (CDT), the stream reservation (SR) and the best effort (BE). A hierarchical scheduling infrastructure for the three types of messages are presented, which consists of three scheduling strategies, i.e., FIFO, CBS and TAS. For the hierarchical scheduling mechanism, the influences of both FIFO and TAS on CBS are analyzed and an approach for the derivation of worst-case response times of SR message is proposed. The experiments in Vector CANoe show that the proposed method in this paper can effectively obtain the upper bound of SR message transmission in TSN. It can be used to improve the design of TSN system.

TI  - Queue assignment for fixed-priority real-time flows in time-sensitive networks: Hardness and algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Time sensitive networks (TSNs) enable deterministic real-time communication over Ethernet networks. According to IEEE 802.1Qbv standards, TSN switches use gates between queues and their corresponding egress ports to facilitate timing-deterministic communications. Management of switch resources, such as queues, has a significant impact on the schedulability of real-time flows. In this paper, we look into the theoretical foundation of queue management in TSN switches. We prove that the queue assignment problem for realtime flows on time sensitive networks under static priority scheduling is NP-hard in the strong sense, even if the number of queues per port is 3. Then we formulate the problem as a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) specification. Besides, we propose a worst case response time analysis and a fast heuristic algorithms by eliminating scheduling conflicts. Experiments with randomly generated workload demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms for queue assignment of real-time flows.

TI  - Adaptive Priority Adjustment Scheduling Approach With Response-Time Analysis in Time-Sensitive Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the advent of Industry 4.0 and the popularization of smart terminal equipment, the interaction between industrial field information systems and production equipment has intensified. To meet the real-time transmission of time-triggered flow and the coordinated transmission of best effort flow, time-sensitive network-related technologies are used to implement flow queue forwarding by strictly following the gate control list. First, response-time analysis method is proposed to predict the upper bound of delay under a scheduling model following IEEE 802.1Qbv. Second, according to response-time analysis, a deadline monotonic scheduling algorithm with temporary priority expansion is proposed to divide the priority into more levels, which is not limited by the queue type, so as to ameliorate the transmission sequence of switch export flow. Finally, an adaptive priority adjustment scheduling algorithm with temporary priority expansion is designed to construct the optimal scheduling method further improving the scheduling success rate and reducing worst-case end-to-end delays. Compared with similar algorithms, the algorithm proposed improves the scheduling success rate by at least 30%, reduces the total delay by at least 21% and the TT flow delay by 11% in high network utilization conditions.

TI  - Schedulability analysis of Time-Sensitive Networks with scheduled traffic and preemption support
T2  - JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) set of standards introduces in IEEE 802.1 switches and end stations novel features to meet the requirements of a broad spectrum of applications that are characterized by time-sensitive and mission-critical traffic flows. In particular, the IEEE802.1Qbv-2015 amendment introduces enhancements that provide temporal isolation for scheduled traffic, i.e., a traffic class that requires transmission based on a known timescale, while the IEEE802.1Qbu-2016 introduces preemption as a mechanism to allow time-critical messages to interrupt ongoing non time-critical transmissions. Both amendments, that are now enrolled in the IEEE802.1Q-2018 standard, are very important for industrial networks, where scheduled traffic and low-latency real-time flows have to coexist, on the same network, with best-effort transmissions.In this context, this work presents a response time analysis of TSN networks that encompasses the enhancements for scheduled traffic and preemption, in various combinations. The paper presents the proposed analysis and a performance comparison between the response times calculated by the analysis and the response times obtained through OMNeT++ simulations in three different scenarios.

TI  - Worst-Case Latency Analysis for IEEE 802.1Qbv Time Sensitive Networks Using Network Calculus
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Distributed safety-critical applications in industrial automation, aerospace, and automotive, require worst-case end-to-end latency analysis for critical communication flows in order to prove their correct behavior in the temporal domain With the advent of time sensitive networks (TSNs), distributed applications can be built on top of standard Ethernet technologies without sacrificing real-time characteristics. The time-based transmission selection and clock synchronization mechanism defined in the TSN enable the real-time transmission of frames based on a global schedule configured through so-called gate control lists (GCLs). This paper has an enhancement of allowing a mixture of the priority-based scheduling and time-triggered, which expand the solution space for the GCLs. Then, it is necessary to analyze the latency bounds for the critical traffic in the TSN network. In this paper, we start from the assumption that the GCLs, i.e., the communication schedules, and the traffic class (priority) assignment for critical flows are given for each output port and derive, using network calculus, an analysis of the worst-case delays that individual critical flows can experience along the hops from sender to receiver(s). Our method can be employed for the analysis of the TSNs where the GCLs have been created in advance, as well as for driving the GCL synthesis that explores a larger solution space than previous methods, which required a complete isolation of transmission events from different traffic classes. We validate our model and analysis by performing experiments on both synthetic and real-world use-cases, showing the scalability of our implementation as well as the impact of certain GCL properties (gate overlapping and traffic class assignments) on the worst-case latency of critical communication flows.

TI  - Wireless/wired integrated transmission for industrial cyber-physical systems: risk-sensitive co-design of 5G and TSN protocols
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing popularity of intelligent manufacturing is driven by deterministic transmission demands of applications in industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS). However, the ossified shortages of industrial wireless communication such as diverse quality of service (QoS) and complex signaling processes incur a severe long tail of transmission delay distribution. As a solution, the 5th generation (5G) wireless communication technology provides ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) for industry scenarios. Moreover, the newly proposed time-sensitive networking (TSN) standards guarantee the transmission determinacy by gate mechanism. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous time-sensitive network (HTSN) co-designed by 5G and TSN. We first develop a predictive multi-priority wireless scheduling mechanism based on semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) to reduce signaling delay by reserving resources in advance. Then we propose an adaptive data injection mechanism for TSN based on per-stream filtering and policing (PSFP), which dynamically adjusts the priority of data for queue injection in TSN. To further reduce the long tail of delay, we employ a risk-sensitive learning method to improve the worst-case delay. Simulations on a hot rolling production scenario demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms under HTSN achieve great performance in terms of integrated delay and resource utilization.

TI  - Worst-Case Latency Analysis for AVB Traffic Under Overlapping-Based Time-Triggered Windows in Time-Sensitive Networks
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deterministic and low end-to-end latency communication is an urgent demand for many safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles and automated industries. The time-sensitive network (TSN) is introduced as Ethernet-based amendments in IEEE 802.1 TSN standards to support time-triggered (TT) traffic in these applications. In the presence of TT flows, TSN is designed to integrate Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) and Best Effort (BE) traffic types. Although AVB traffic has a lower priority than TT, it still requires low and deterministic latency performance, which may not be guaranteed under strict predefined TT scheduling constraints. For this reason, a window-overlapping scheduling algorithm is recently proposed in different works as analytical forms for TT latency under overlapping-windows based. But worst-case AVB latency evaluation under overlapped TT windows is also essential for critical optimizations and tradeoffs. In this paper, a worst-case end-to-end delay (WCD) for AVB traffic under overlapping-based TT windows (AVB-OBTTW) algorithm is proposed. Separate analytical models are derived using the network calculus (NC) approach for AVB-OBTTW with both non-preemption and preemption mechanisms. Using an actual vehicular use case, the proposed models are evaluated with back-to-back and porosity configurations under light and heavy loading scenarios. For specific AVB credit bounds, a clear WCD reduction has been achieved by increasing the overlapping ratio (OR), especially under back-to-back configuration. Preemption and non-preemption modes are compared under different loading conditions, resulting in lower WCDs using preemption mode than non-preemption, especially with porosity style. Compared to the latest related works, AVB-OBTTW reduces WCD bounds and increases unscheduled bandwidth, leading to the highest enhancements with the maximum allowable OR.

AB  - Worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis is a prevalent way to ensure the timely execution of programs in time-critical systems. With the advent of new technologies such as fog computing and time-sensitive networking (TSN), the interest in timing analysis has increased in industrial communication. This paper highlights experiences made while adjusting the publisher of the open62541 OPC UA stack to enable WCET analysis, following a simple process combined with the open-source platform T-CREST. The main challenges are the required knowledge about the code and the specific communication software characteristics like variable message sizes. Other findings indicate the need for other types of annotation for indirect recursion or callback functions. The paper provides the foundation for further research on adjusting the implementation of existing industrial communication protocols for WCET analysis.

CP  - 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)

AB  - This paper presents a schedulability analysis for the Best-Effort (BE) traffic class within Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) networks. The presented analysis considers several features in the TSN standards, including the Credit-Based Shaper (CBS), the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) and the frame preemption. Although the BE class in TSN is primarily used for the traffic with no strict timing requirements, some industrial applications prefer to utilize this class for the non-hard real-time traffic instead of classes that use the CBS. The reason mainly lies in the fact that the complexity of TSN configuration becomes significantly high when the time-triggered traffic via the TAS and other classes via the CBS are used altogether. We demonstrate the applicability of the presented analysis on a vehicular application use case. We show that a network designer can get information on the schedulability of the BE traffic, based on which the network configuration can be further refined with respect to the application requirements.

TI  - EDF scheduling for distributed systems built upon the IEEE 802.1AS clock-A theoretical-practical comparison
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing response time analysis and optimization techniques for real-time distributed systems show that EDF schedulers feature better scheduling capabilities when a global clock reference can be used; this form of scheduling is known as global-clock EDF. In this context, precise clock synchronization is an enabling technology for future distributed real-time systems that want to leverage EDF scheduling. The IEEE 802.1AS protocol can be considered a stable technology for this purpose, as it is part of the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) family of standards to provide real-time communication over Ethernet. This paper presents a system architecture for applying global-clock EDF scheduling in distributed systems with soft real-time requirements. It also presents experiments to (1) assess the synchronization capabilities of the clock synchronization mechanism in the pro-posed architecture, (2) evaluate the performance of different scheduling deadline assignment techniques, and (3) contrast the theoretical results obtained by the schedulability analysis against those obtained through the execution of these experiments.

AB  - The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) set of standards allows to support on the same channel the different kinds of traffic flows that are typically found in automotive scenarios. This article proposes the introduction of online Earliest Deadline First-based scheduling in TSN to provide support for event-driven real-time traffic. The proposed approach, called Deadline-TSN, is an online approach, and therefore, unlike other approaches in the literature, it does not require complex offline schedule calculations. Moreover, Deadline-TSN is able to uniformly deal with real-time periodic and event-driven traffic flows. This article presents Deadline-TSN and provides both worst-case response time analysis and simulative assessments in realistic automotive scenarios.

AB  - Ethernet is nowadays a promising communication technology for automotive applications as, comparing with the existing in-vehicle networks, it offers high bandwidth and a significant reduction of cabling costs, while meeting the EMC/EMI requirements of automotive communications. The IEEE 802.1Q standard is one of the base standards of Time-Sensitive Networking. It offers several benefits, such as the real-time support, as it provides bounded latency to time-constrained traffic classes, with zero jitter and congestion-free transmissions, and the capability to handle multiple traffic classes on the same channel. The IEEE 802.1Q standard specifies multiple features, that support different ways to handle the transmission of Ethernet frames. In this paper a comparative performance assessment of three network configurations defined in the IEEE 802.1Q standard for automotive applications are presented. The assessment results are obtained using the OMNeT++ framework. The comparison between the results of these three different network configurations, using realistic traffic patterns, provides a quantitative evaluation of the network performance in terms of maximum end-to-end delays and absolute jitter.

AB  - This paper presents the first holistic modeling approach for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) communication that integrates into a model- and component-based software development framework for distributed embedded systems. Based on these new models, we also present an end-to-end timing model for TSN-interconnected distributed embedded systems. Our approach is expressive enough to model the timing information of TSN and the timing behaviour of software that communicates over TSN, hence allowing end-to-end timing analysis. A proof of concept for the proposed approach is provided by implementing it for a component model and tool suite used in the vehicle industry. Moreover, a use case from the vehicle industry is modeled and analyzed with the proposed approach to demonstrate its usability.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) introduces standardized mechanisms that add real-time capabilities to IEEE 802.1 Ethernet networks. In particular, the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) can be used to send frames in a deterministic fashion according to a predefined global schedule. Existing methods for generating the global communication schedule enforce isolation either in the time or in the space domain. This extended abstract presents a novel, more flexible window-based scheduling algorithm which removes the previously required isolation constraints for Scheduled Traffic (ST) by integrating worst-case delay analysis to guarantee bounded latency.

TI  - Time-Sensitive Network Simulation for In-Vehicle Ethernet Using SARSA Algorithm
T2  - WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to more accurately analyze the problem of time delay simulation and calculation in the time-sensitive network (TSN) of vehicular Ethernet, a TSN reservation class data delay analysis model improved based on the State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the TSN data queue forwarding delay model and reservation class data delay analysis intelligent body model are established, then the TSN traffic scheduling mechanism is improved by the SARSA reinforcement learning algorithm, and the improved TSN network reservation class data analysis model is established for the uncertainty of traffic scheduling in the network; finally, the fitting performance of the proposed method is verified by simulation and experimental validation. The results show that the deviation between the two is less than 5% under different BE loads, i.e., the established reservation class data delay analysis model is able to correctly fit the scheduling mechanism of the vehicle-mounted TSN network, which proves the reasonableness of the model simulation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we identify that the existing end-to-end data propagation delay analysis for distributed embedded systems can calculate pessimistic (over-estimated) analysis results when the nodes are synchronized. This is particularly the case of the Scheduled Traffic (ST) class in Time-sensitive Networking (TSN), which is scheduled offline according to the IEEE 802.1Qbv standard and the nodes are synchronized according to the IEEE 802.1AS standard. We present a comprehensive system model for distributed embedded systems that incorporates all of the above mentioned aspect as well as all traffic classes in TSN. We extend the analysis to support both synchronization and non-synchronization among the ECUs as well as offline schedules on the networks. The extended analysis can now be used to analyze all traffic classes in TSN when the nodes are synchronized without introducing any pessimism in the analysis results. We evaluate the proposed model and the extended analysis on a vehicular industrial use case.

AB  - In this paper, we model and analyse the timing performance of an extended AFDX standard, incorporating the Burst Limiting Shaper (BLS) proposed by the Time Sensitive Networking group. The extended AFDX will enable the interconnection of different avionics domains with mixed-criticality levels, e.g., current AFDX traffic, Flight Control and In-Flight Entertainment. First, we present the model and the worst-case timing analysis, using the Network Calculus framework, of such an extended AFDX to infer real-time guarantees. Secondly, we conduct its performance evaluation on a representative AFDX configuration. Results show the tightness of the proposed model, with reference to simulation results. Moreover, they confirm the efficiency of incorporating the BLS in the AFDX standard to noticeably enhance the medium priority level delay bounds, while respecting the higher priority level constraints, in comparison with the current AFDX standard.

AB  - In this paper, we present an end-to-end timing model to capture timing information from software architectures of distributed embedded systems that use network communication based on the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards. Such a model is required as an input to perform end-to-end timing analysis of these systems. Furthermore, we present a methodology that aims at automated extraction of instances of the end-to-end timing model from component-based software architectures of the systems and the TSN network configurations. As a proof of concept, we implement the proposed end-to-end timing model and the extraction methodology in the Rubus Component Model (RCM) and its tool chain Rubus-ICE that are used in the vehicle industry. We demonstrate the usability of the proposed model and methodology by modeling a vehicular industrial use case and performing its timing analysis.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a collection of standards that extend Ethernet to support safety-critical and real-time applications. TSN integrates multiple traffic types, i.e., Time-Triggered (TT) traffic scheduled based on Gate-Control-Lists (GCLs), Audio-Video-Bridging (AVB) traffic that requires bounded latencies, and Best-Effort (BE) traffic, for which no guarantees are provided. This paper proposes a Network Calculus-based approach to determine the worst-case end-to-end delays of AVB traffic in a TSN network with both non-preemption and preemption modes. We consider the effects of TT traffic due to GCLs, "guard bands", i.e., time windows that block other traffic from transmitting, and preemption overhead on the service for AVB traffic. We provide a proof of non-overflow condition for AVB credit, which is used to control the AVB traffic transmission. The analysis method is evaluated on realistic test cases, and compared to related work.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN) enhance standard IEEE 802.1Q Ethernet devices with real-time and time-aware capabilities. The forwarding of time-critical frames is done according to a so-called Gate Control List (GCL) schedule via the timed-gate mechanism introduced in IEEE 802.1Qbv. Most TSN scheduling mechanisms impose that all devices in the network must have the TSN capabilities related to scheduled gates and time synchronization. However, this is often an unrealistic assumption since many distributed applications use heterogeneous TSN networks with legacy or off-the-shelf end systems that are unscheduled and/or unsynchronized.This paper proposes a novel, more flexible TSN scheduling algorithm that intertwines a worst-case delay analysis within the scheduling synthesis step. Through this, we leverage the solution's optimality to support heterogeneous TSN networks featuring unscheduled and/or unsynchronized end-systems while still guaranteeing the timeliness of critical communication. We evaluate the performance of our approach using both synthetic and real-world use cases, comparing it with existing TSN scheduling mechanisms. Furthermore, we use OMNET++ to validate the generated GCL schedules.

AB  - To cope with requirements for low latency, the upcoming Ethernet standard Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) provides enhancements for scheduled traffic, enabling mixed-criticality networks where critical messages are sent according to a system-wide schedule. While these networks provide a completely predictable behavior of the scheduled traffic by construction, timing analysis of the critical non-scheduled traffic with hard deadlines remains an unsolved issue. State-of-the-art analysis approaches consider the interference that unscheduled messages impose on each other, but there is currently no approach to determine the worst-case interference that can be imposed by scheduled traffic, the so-called schedule interference (SI), without relying on restrictions of the shape of the schedule. Considering all possible interference scenarios during each calculation of the SI is impractical, as it results in an explosion of the computation time. As a remedy, this paper proposes a) an approach to integrate the analysis of the worst-case SI into state-of-the-art timing analysis approaches and b) preprocessing techniques that reduce the computation time of the SI-calculation by several orders of magnitude without introducing any pessimism.

AB  - The IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards' amendment 802.1Qbv provides real-time guarantees for Scheduled Traffic (ST) streams by the Time Aware Shaper (TAS) mechanism. In this paper, we develop offline schedule optimization objective functions to configure the TAS for ST streams, which can be effective to achieve a high Quality of Service (QoS) of lower priority Best-Effort (BE) traffic. This becomes useful if real-time streams from legacy protocols are configured to be carried by the BE class or if the BE class is used for value-added (but non-critical) services. We present three alternative objective functions, namely Maximization, Sparse and Evenly Sparse, followed by a set of constraints on ST streams. Based on simulated stream traces in OMNeT++/INET TSN NeSTiNg simulator, we compare our proposed schemes with a most commonly applied objective function in terms of overall maximum end-to-end delay and deadline misses of BE streams. The results confirm that changing the schedule synthesis objective to our proposed schemes ensures timely delivery and lower end-to-end delays in BE streams.

TI  - Joint Algorithm of Message Fragmentation and No-Wait Scheduling for Time-Sensitive Networks
T2  - IEEE-CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMATICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-sensitive networks (TSNs) support not only traditional best-effort communications but also deterministic communications, which send each packet at a deterministic time so that the data transmissions of networked control systems can be precisely scheduled to guarantee hard real-time constraints. No-wait scheduling is suitable for such TSNs and generates the schedules of deterministic communications with the minimal network resources so that all of the remaining resources can be used to improve the throughput of best-effort communications. However, due to inappropriate message fragmentation, the real-time performance of no-wait scheduling algorithms is reduced. Therefore, in this paper, joint algorithms of message fragmentation and no-wait scheduling are proposed. First, a specification for the joint problem based on optimization modulo theories is proposed so that off-the-shelf solvers can be used to find optimal solutions. Second, to improve the scalability of our algorithm, the worst-case delay of messages is analyzed, and then, based on the analysis, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to construct low-delay schedules. Finally, we conduct extensive test cases to evaluate our proposed algorithms. The evaluation results indicate that, compared to existing algorithms, the proposed joint algorithm improves schedulability by up to 50%.

AB  - Switched Ethernet has been proposed as network technology for automotive and industrial applications. IEEE AVB is a collection of standards that specifies (among other elements) a set of network traffic shaping mechanisms (i.e., rules to regulate the traffic flow) to have guaranteed Quality of Service for Audio/Video traffic. However, in-vehicle control applications like advanced driver-assistance systems require much lower latencies than provided by this standard. Within the context of IEEE TSN (Time Sensitive Networking), three new traffic shaping mechanisms are considered, named Burst Limiting, Time Aware and Peristaltic shaper respectively. In this paper we explain and compare these shapers, we examine their worst case end-to-end latencies analytically and we investigate their behavior through a simulation of a particular setup. We show that the shapers hardly satisfy the requirements for 100Mbps Ethernet, but can come close under further restrictions. We also show the impact the shapers have on AVB traffic.

AB  - Ethernet is considered as a future communication standard for distributed embedded systems in the automotive and industrial domains. A key challenge is the deterministic low-latency transport of Ethernet frames, as many safety-critical real-time applications in these domains have tight timing requirements. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an upcoming set of Ethernet standards, which (among other things) address these requirements by specifying new quality of service mechanisms in the form of different traffic shapers. In this paper, we consider TSN's time-aware and peristaltic shapers and evaluate whether these shapers are able to fulfill these strict timing requirements. We present a formal timing analysis, which is a key requirement for the adoption of Ethernet in safety-critical real-time systems, to derive worst-case latency bounds for each shaper. We use a realistic automotive Ethernet setup to compare these shapers to each other and against Ethernet following IEEE 802.1Q.

AB  - Real-time switched Ethernet communication is of increasing importance in many cyber-physical and embedded systems application areas such as automotive electronics, avionics, and industrial control. The IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group develops standards for real-time Ethernet, for example a time-triggered traffic class (IEEE 802.1Qbv-2015). New application areas, such as active safety and autonomous driving using radar, lidar, and camera sensors, which do not fall into the strictly periodic, time-triggered communication model, require a flexible traffic class that can accommodate various communication models while still providing hard real-time guarantees. In our previous work, we developed such a traffic class, Urgency-Based Scheduler (UBS), and its worst-case latency analysis. UBS is currently under standardization (P802.1Qcr) in the TSN task group. In this paper, we introduce and solve the UBS synthesis problem of assigning hard real-time data flows to queues and priority levels to queues, the main parameters that determine communication latencies. The synthesis problem is particularly challenging due to the flexibility offered by UBS to aggregate flows and assign individual priority levels per network hop. We present an SMT approach, a cluster-based heuristic, and an extensive experimental evaluation.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - With the advancement of Industry 4.0, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has become essential for ensuring prompt and reliable data transmission. As an augmentation of Ethernet, TSN aims to supply services capable of low latency, minimal jitter, and low packet loss for urgent data in decentralized, user-oriented networks. Efficient detection techniques are integral to TSN for swiftly determining the practicability of network configurations, as existing schedulability analysis proves insufficient. This paper delves into the potential of backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) in schedulability analysis efficiency. We optimize BPNN using spearman correlation feature selection combined with a voting ensemble method and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), forming two models: Spearman-Vote-BPNN and Spearman-PSO-BPNN. Testing on 5,000 network configurations in computer simulations, both models demonstrated high generalization accuracy, around 97.4%. Spearman-Vote-BPNN achieved the fastest training speed at 0.63 s and an accuracy of 98.2%. Meanwhile, Spearman-PSO-BPNN showed the highest accuracy (98.5%) with the quickest detection speed (5.6 ms). The outcomes of this research significantly advance the efficacy and precision of TSN network configuration detection and establish a formidable groundwork for future scholarly pursuits in this area.

CP  - 25th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)

AB  - IEC 61850 has become the reference standard for Substation Automation Systems (SAS) in smart power grids. Current IEC 61850 compliant SAS use Ethernet technology for both Event-Triggered (ET) and Time-Triggered (TT) traffic to transport highly critical messages requiring low-latency guarantees. However the real-time guarantee is often achieved by over-provisioning network resources. In this paper we study the potentials of using Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) in SAS. TSN adds real-time enhancement to the existing IEEE 802.1Q standard by providing several new traffic shapers. If TT traffic can be guaranteed by scheduling its transmission at the right time using TSN time-aware shaper, it is not the case for ET traffic. The paper contribution is twofold: proposing a first mapping of the IEC 61850 protocols to the TSN traffic classes, based on the analysis of both TSN and IEC 61850 protocols; and developing an exact worst-case delay (WCD) analysis for ET traffic. The tightness of the developed WCD analysis has be shown by simulations.

TI  - State-of-the-art Survey on Deterministic Transmission Technologies in Time-sensitive Networking
T2  - Journal of Software
M3  - Review
AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an important research area to update infrastructure of industrial internet of things. Deterministic transmission in TSN is the key technology, mainly including time-triggered scheduling in control plane, mixed-criticality transmission, and deterministic delay analysis, to support deterministic real-time transmission requirements for industrial control. This study surveys the related works on deterministic transmission technologies of TSN in recent years and systematically cards and summarizes them. First, this study presents the different transmission models of different kinds of flows in TSN. Second, based on these models, on the one hand, this study presents time-triggered scheduling model and its research status and existing challenges on control plane. On the other hand, this paper presents the architecture of TSN switches, the strategies of mixed-criticality transmission and their disadvantages and the corresponding improvement approaches. Third, this study models the transmission delay of the whole TSN based on netowork calculus and presents the delay analysis methods, their research status and possible improvement directions. Finally, this study summarizes the challenges and research prospects of deterministic transmission technologies in TSN.

TI  - Zero Jitter for Deterministic Networks Without Time-Synchronization
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The demands for deterministic network services are getting significant. IEEE Time sensitive networking (TSN) task group has aimed for deterministic services through IEEE 802 networks. TSN's solutions rely on the time-synchronization and the slot scheduling coordinated throughout a network. The former requires costly hardware implementations for accuracy and scalability. The latter requires a schedulability analysis, which is proven to be NP-complete and not scalable. For modest-to-large scale dynamic networks, a more flexible solution is necessary. We propose a scalable framework that guarantees any desired jitter upper bound, including zero jitter. The framework is composed of; packets with relative time-stamps, a network that guarantees latency bounds, and buffers at the network egress. The latency bounds of a network can be of any value. The buffer holds packets for predetermined intervals to reproduce arbitrary inter-arrival intervals to inter-departure intervals, based on the network's latency bound. The idea behind the proposed framework is to minimize the latency first with work-conserving schedulers, and then adjust the jitter at the egress of a network. We argue that this is simpler than minimizing latency and jitter at the same time. A direct benefit of such simplicity is its scalability. We examine the network solutions that guarantee latency bound, such as the DiffServ and the Flow aggregate-interleave regulator (FAIR), as the candidates for the component in the framework. We show with a case study and simulations that the proposed framework can guarantee smaller latency bounds, with zero jitter, than those of the TSN's synchronous approach.

AB  - The Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) amendments and protocols add capabilities on top of standard 802.1 Ethernet for guaranteeing the timeliness of both (isochronous) scheduled traffic (ST) and shaped (audio-video) communication (AVB) in distributed applications. ST streams are guaranteed via an offline computed schedule controlling the time-aware gate mechanism of IEEE 802.1Qbv, while AVB real-time streams are shaped via a credit-based shaper (CBS) and scheduler with lower-priority than ST. Although the two traffic classes use different TSN mechanisms, they are interrelated as the ST traffic class schedule influences the latency of AVB traffic.In this paper, we propose a method for the integration of the ST schedule synthesis with an analysis for the AVB class featuring IEEE 802.1Qbu frame preemption under different configurations to reduce the interference between the two classes. We first present a new worst-case response-time (WCRT) analysis for the AVB traffic class in TSN networks with preemption, considering an arbitrary number of AVB queues and different configurations for the CBS credit behavior. Then, we integrate the creation of ST schedule tables with the schedulability analysis of AVB traffic using a heuristic algorithm featuring frame preemption and a novel routing mechanism aimed at maximizing AVB schedulability. Finally, we evaluate our approach using both real-world and synthetic use cases showing the efficiency both in terms of schedule creation runtime and in terms of increasing the schedulability of lower-priority AVB traffic.

TI  - Worst-Case Timing Analysis of AFDX Networks With Multiple TSN/BLS Shapers
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the problem of worst-case timing analysis of extended Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) networks, incorporating Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) shapers called Burst Limiting Shapers (BLS), to enable the interconnection of different avionics domains with mixed-criticality levels, e.g., current AFDX traffic, Flight Control and In-Flight Entertainment. Conducting such an analysis is a challenging issue when considering multiple BLS-shaped traffic classes, due to the sophisticated inter-dependencies between the different shapers sharing the same output capacity. We tackle this problem through extending the applicability domain of our previous work for computing maximum delay bounds using Network Calculus and considering only one BLS class, called Continuous Credit-based Approach (CCbA), to handle multiple TSN/BLS classes. We provide further insights into the sensitivity and tightness issues of worst-case delay bounds yielded with the Generalized CCbA (GCCbA). Our assessments show that the tightness ratio is up to 85& x0025;, with reference to Achievable Worst-Case delays. We also show the improvements against recent state-of-the-art approaches in terms of tightness and complexity, where the computation time is up to 10(5) faster. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of GCCbA for realistic avionics case studies, e.g., adding A350 flight control traffic to the AFDX. Results show the good applicability of GCCbA and confirm the efficiency of the extended AFDX, which decreases the delay bounds of the existing AFDX traffic by up to 49.9& x0025;, in comparison with the current AFDX standard.

TI  - Formal Modeling of Frame Selection in Asynchronous TSN Communications
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The asynchronous time-sensitive networking (TSN) based on IEEE 802.1Qcr is expected to be a promising solution for the asynchronous transmissions of safety-critical flows without the support of clock synchronization. When the asynchronous traffic shaping (ATS) mechanism is adopted to meet the deadline requirements for transmissions of safety-critical flow, it is necessary to formally verify the real-time properties and corresponding network performance. However, it is still unclear how to build an efficient formal model to evaluate different frame selection methods during the ATS scheduling process, which originate from the dominations of priority or eligibility time. In this paper, we present a formal modeling framework to compare the impacts of different frame selection on transmission sequence under the ATS mechanism. According to the priority level (pATS) or eligibility time (eATS) for flows, two transmission selection methods in ATS are modeled and compared. Then, we verify the real-time properties of ATS. The result shows that the shaping-for-free property can be satisfied with the pATS method but can not be fulfilled with the eATS method. Besides, the timing analysis results illustrate that the eATS method can provide more fairness than the pATS method for the transmission of low-priority flows in TSN networks.

AB  - Controller Area Network (CAN) and Ethernet network are expected to co-exist in automotive industry as Ethernet provides a high-bandwidth communication, while CAN is a legacy cost-effective solution. Due to the shortcomings of conventional switched Etherent, such as determinism, IEEE Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group developed a set of standards to enhance the switched Ethernet technology providing low-jitter and deterministic communication. Considering these two network domains, we investigate various design approaches for a gateway that connects a CAN domain to a TSN domain. We present three gateway forwarding techniques and we develop end-to-end delay analysis methods for them. Via the analysis methods and applying them to synthetic use cases we show that the intuitive existing approach of encapsulating multiple CAN frames into a single Ethernet frame is not necessarily an efficient solution. In fact, we demonstrate several cases where it is preferable to encapsulate only one CAN frame into a TSN frame, in particular when we use a high speed TSN network. The results have a significant impact on developing such gateways as the implementation of the one-to-one frame encapsulation is considerably simpler than other complex gateway-forwarding techniques.

AB  - Many Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications have zero fault tolerance. Redundant networks are hence an important prerequisite for a dependable infrastructure to serve the various data traffic classes required for such applications. In this paper, we perform a delay analysis of a Quality Checks After Production (QCAP) application, which is running on a Time-Sensitive Network (TSN). We evaluate the worst-case delay of all data flows traversing the redundant TSN network using a Network Calculus (NC) based framework. We also evaluate how network parameters and configurations affect the QCAP application's service requirements.

T2  - WIRELESS NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Current safety-critical applications, found in domains such as automotive networking, automated industries, and control systems, require deterministic and latency-bounded end-to-end communication, currently not supported by best-effort networks. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is the most feasible approach to fulfill such requirements. Originating from the wired domain, their application to the wireless domain is now attracting attention. Besides some advances in time synchronization and scheduling, essential policies such as association with a wireless TSN (W-TSN), have not been explored. This paper analyses the necessary tools for a prospective client to accomplish association with the W-TSN without affecting ongoing time-sensitive traffic. We introduce three beacon-based methods to pre-synchronize and pre-schedule nodes willing to associate with the network. On top of the first full-stack Software Defined Radio (SDR) based IEEE802.11/Wi-Fi design, the proposed approaches are developed and tested in a real-world environment. A delay analysis shows a worst-case association delay of up to 1.8 s, and high accuracy synchronization on prospective clients' association frame receptions, with 100% of on-time arrivals, even with challenging scheduling timeslots as short as 128 mu\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\upmu$$\end{document}s.

AB  - Future in-vehicle networks will use Ethernet as their communication backbone. As many automotive applications are latency-sensitive and have strict real- time requirements, a key challenge in automotive network design is the deterministic low-latency transport of latency-critical Ethernet frames. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an upcoming set of Ethernet standards, which address these requirements by specifying new quality of service mechanisms in the form of different traffic shapers. One of these traffic shapers is the burst-limiting shaper (BLS). In this paper, we evaluate whether BLS is able to fulfill these strict timing requirements. We present a formal timing analysis for BLS in order to compute worst-case latency bounds. We use a realistic automotive Ethernet setup to compare BLS against Ethernet AVB and Ethernet following IEEE 802.1Q.

AB  - Distributed embedded systems for safety-critical applications demand reliable communication with real-time characteristics. Switched Ethernet-based network is a practical and scalable solution that allows high-reliability level through path redundancy. The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standard is being developed to support real-time communication which supports a deterministic and low latency communication for safety-critical control applications, namely, Time-Triggered (TT) traffic class. In addition, a bounded-latency traffic class, namely, Audio Video Bridging (AVB) class is introduced. In this paper, we propose a multipath routing technique which tackles both TT and AVB traffic simultaneously. The proposed approach investigates satisfying path redundancy requirements for each message while the imposed interference from TT traffic on AVB traffic is minimized. The considered routing problem is formalized as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization problem. The Worst Case end-to-end Delay (WCD) is the optimization objective. 50 test cases of various network size and number of messages are solved to evaluate the performance, i.e., interference reduction, and the scalability of the proposed technique. Results demonstrate WCD reduction up to 90% comparing to the typical routing approach that determines TT and AVB routing in separate steps.

AB  - Flow control is of particular importance in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), where timeliness of messages is guaranteed through several types of traffic shaping. This has given rise to a number of papers discussing the worst-case response time analysis of, in particular, the credit-based traffic shaping approach. In this work-in-progress paper, we concern ourselves with the possibility that traffic shaping can be applied in different layers of the protocol stack, e.g. the physical layer and link layer, which may give rise to different credit behaviors. We convey our concern that the analysis performed in literature seems to assume application of traffic shaping in the physical layer, and that the analysis therefore cannot be readily used in a context where shaping is applied in a higher layer. In particular, assuming application of credit-based shaping in the link layer, there are different interpretations possible for credit behavior. Depending on the interpretation, some of the basic properties of credit, that are crucial for the analysis, may no longer be valid after overhead is added by the physical layer. As an ongoing effort, we plan to revisit the eligible interval analysis of [1] with an adaptation for a link layer interpretation of the standard concerning application of traffic shaping.

AB  - Network technologies are being developed to increase not only performance of data communication but also for provision of deterministic guarantees. Such designs foster the development of distributed real-time applications. When networks must provide time-sensitive communication, a commonly found design feature is First-In First-Out (FIFO) - a natural design for multiplexing different data flows into queues and for scheduling queued data. Alongside technological advancements, there is the development of formal tools to reason about timing behavior. Network Calculus is such a methodology. It has been widely adopted already and its modeling capabilities were extended to features found in modern standards as, e.g., in IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking. However, the basic challenge to compute a deterministic bound on a flow's worst-case end-to-end delay in FIFO networks still imposes challenges. Different analyses exist but often offer limited scalability. In this paper, we present an analysis with a readily tunable tradeoff between quality of the delay bound and the computational effort it imposes. We combine a greedy algorithm with an iterative directed search whose termination criterion can be adapted, e.g., subject to the analyzed network size. Our approach provides bounds of competitive quality at smaller computational cost than current alternatives for the analysis of feedforward FIFO networks.

TI  - Enhanced Real-time Scheduling of AVB Flows in Time-Sensitive Networking
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) realizes high bandwidth and time determinism for data transmission and thus becomes the crucial communication technology in time-critical systems. The Gate Control List (GCL) is used to control the transmission of different classes of traffic in TSN, including Time-Triggered (TT) flows, Audio-Video-Bridging (AVB) flows, and Best-Effort (BE) flows. Most studies focus on optimizing GCL synthesis by reserving the preceding time slots to serve TT flows with the strict delay requirement, but ignore the deadlines of non-TT flows and cause the large delay. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive scheduling method to enhance the real-time scheduling of AVB flows while guaranteeing the time determinism of TT flows. This method first optimizes GCL synthesis to reserve the preceding time slots for AVB flows, and then introduces the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) method to further improve the transmission of AVB flows by considering their deadlines. Moreover, the worst-case delay (WCD) analysis method is proposed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the transmission of AVB flows compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - On Packet Reordering in Time-Sensitive Networks
T2  - IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-sensitive networks (IEEE TSN or IETF DetNet) may tolerate some packet reordering. Re-sequencing buffers are then used to provide in-order delivery, the parameters of which (timeout, buffer size) may affect worst-case delay and delay jitter. There is so far no precise understanding of per-flow reordering metrics nor of the dimensioning of re-sequencing buffers in order to provide worst-case guarantees, as required in such networks. First, we show that a previously proposed per-flow metric, reordering late time offset (RTO), determines the timeout value. If the network is lossless, another previously defined metric, the reordering byte offset (RBO), determines the required buffer. If packet losses cannot be ignored, the required buffer may be larger than RBO, and depends on jitter, an arrival curve of the flow at its source, and the timeout. Then we develop a calculus to compute the RTO for a flow path; the method uses a novel relation with jitter and arrival curve, together with a decomposition of the path into non order-preserving and order-preserving elements. We also analyse the effect of re-sequencing buffers on worst-case delay, jitter and propagation of arrival curves. We show in particular that, in a lossless (but non order-preserving) network, re-sequencing is ``for free'', namely, it does not increase worst-case delay nor jitter, whereas in a lossy network, re-sequencing increases the worst-case delay and jitter. We apply the analysis to evaluate the performance impact of placing re-sequencing buffers at intermediate points and illustrate the results on two industrial test cases.

AB  - Most of the recent researches related to hybrid traffic scheduling in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) focus on how to ensure bounded low-delay transmission for Scheduled Traffic (ST) and Stream Reservation (SR) traffic. However, if high-priority traffic blocks Best Effort (BE) traffic represented by data logging and periodic software updates for a long time, the end-to-end delay of BE messages will be too large. To reduce the blocking of SR traffic on BE traffic by reducing the reserved bandwidth for SR traffic, this paper proposes a traffic scheduling algorithm combined with ingress shaping. First, add ingress buffers before SR queues. Then, schedule SR traffic on a per-flow basis in the TSN switch by limiting the rate at which frames in each ingress buffer enter the SR queue. Finally, joint egress shaping and ingress shaping to reserve bandwidth resources that match its delay requirement for each SR flow. Simulation results show that the maximum end-to-end delay of BE messages can be reduced by 0.32%similar to 17.19%.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a set of standardised communication protocols developed under the IEEE 802.1 working group. TSN aims to support deterministic communication based on network schedules that are distributively configured. It is widely considered as the future in-vehicle network solution for highly automated driving, where the requirement on timing guarantee is alongside the demand of high communication bandwidth. In this work, we study a setting of periodic control and non-control packets, with implicit and arbitrary deadlines, respectively. As the FIFO (first-in, first-out) queues in the 802.1Qbv switch incur long delay in the worst case, which prevents the control tasks from achieving short sampling periods and thus impedes control performance optimisation, we propose the first fixed-priority scheduling (FPS) approach for TSN by leveraging its gate control features. In this context, we develop a finer-grained frame-level response time analysis, which provides a tighter bound than the conventional packet-level analysis. Building upon FPS and the above analysis, we formulate a co-design optimisation problem to decide the sampling periods and poles of real-time controllers with settling time as the objective to minimise, whilst satisfying the schedulability constraint.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a promising solution for the next generation in-vehicle networks. To enable innovations in adaptability, there is a strong trend to integrate TSN with Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Software-defined TSN requires fast routing algorithms that guarantee the Worst-Case End-to-End Delay (WCED) of the Audio Video Bridging (AVB) flows. However, current AVB flow routing algorithms execute WCED analysis for an exponential amount of route candidates, which is not feasible at run-time. Current WCED analysis of the AVB flows depends on the specific flow setup of other traffic classes. When high-priority flows change, low-priority flows must be adjusted as well to maintain deadline guarantees. In this paper, we propose a per-class flow management scheme to enable run-time routing of the AVB flows. Our composable analysis computes a formal WCED bound of the AVB flows. It does not rely on the flow setup of other traffic classes. So, the WCED and routes can be computed for each traffic class independently and in parallel. Based on the analysis, we develop a fast heuristic algorithm to incrementally route the AVB flows with guaranteed deadlines. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to the existing solutions, the composable analysis is 2.6x faster. The cost is that the WCED bound can be up to 31% higher. When given a similar run-time as existing solutions, the proposed routing algorithm can set up 1.6x more flows. The average time to set up one flow is within 0.14s.

TI  - Latency Analysis of Multiple Classes of AVB Traffic in TSN With Standard Credit Behavior Using Network Calculus
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a set of amendments that extend Ethernet to support distributed safety-critical and real-time applications in the industrial automation, aerospace, and automotive areas. TSN integrates multiple traffic types and supports interactions in several combinations. In this article, we consider the configuration supporting scheduled traffic (ST) based on gate-control lists, audio-video bridging (AVB) traffic according to IEEE 802.1BA that has bounded latencies, and best-effort traffic, for which no guarantees are provided. This article extends the timing analysis method to multiple AVB classes and proofs the credit bounds for multiple classes of AVB traffic, respectively, under frozen and nonfrozen behaviors of credit during guard band (GB). They are prerequisites for nonoverflow credits of credit-based shaper (CBS) and preventing starvation of AVB traffic. Moreover, this article proposes an improved timing analysis method reducing the pessimism for the worst-case end-to-end delays of AVB traffic by considering the limitations from the physical link rate and the output of CBS. Finally, we evaluate the improved analysis method on both synthetic and real-world test cases, showing the significant reduction of pessimism on latency bounds compared to related work and presenting the correctness validation compared with simulation results. We also compare the AVB latency bounds in the case of frozen and nonfrozen credit during GB. Additionally, we evaluate the scalability of our method with variation of the load of ST flows and of the bandwidth reservation for AVB traffic.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) extends traditional Ethernet to support data traffic with ultra-reliability and time-critical requirements for a range of applications in industrial automation, automotive, and aerospace. The TSN standards present guidelines to integrate different types of data traffic over a single converged network. Therefore, it is becoming an enabling technology towards the Industry 4.0 vision of integrating information and operational technologies within future Industrial Internet of Things networks. In this paper, we develop a network calculus based framework to analyse TSN based industrial networks supporting a range of data traffic classes. We apply the framework to study and analyse a well-known industrial use case, Quality Checks After Production (QCAP), with four data traffic types with different requirements in terms of reliability and end-to-end latency. In our evaluation, we validate our framework with a computer simulation model and compare the tightness of the calculated delay bounds to a state-of-the-art approach. We then use our model to analyse the upper bounds on the worst-case delay of the different QCAP traffic types and assess the factors that impact end-to-end delay, e.g. flow offset and critical links. Finally, we compare various credit accumulation rates and their impact on the traffic delay bounds.

AB  - Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet) is a time-critical network for industrial and avionics applications improved from the Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX). It is standardized by SAE AS6802 and satisfies strict timing transmission by use of a mixture infrastructure to support Time-Triggered (TT), Rate-Constraint (RC) and Best-Effort (BE) traffics. The key feature is a time-triggered communication paradigm according to off-line schedule table based on global synchronization. Three integration methods (preemption, timely block and shuffling) are used to resolve conflict when a TT message gets ready and a RC message is already in transmission. Besides several real-time Ethernet solutions, Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) shows great interests and attractions to satisfy the increasing and variable transmission requirements for automotive and aeronautical industry. TSN is comprised of several IEEE standards developed under IEEE 802.1 TSN Task Group, such as 802.1AS, 802.1Qav, 802.1Qat, 802.1BA, 802.1Qbv and 802.1Qbu. On top of SPQ (Static Priority Queuing) scheduling mechanism, with best effort traffics in parallel, TSN introduces guaranteed timing behavior with focus on the transportation for Control Data traffic (CDT) under Time Aware Shaper (TAS) and audio video streams under Credit-Based Shaper (CBS). This paper introduces the basic principles of TSN standard in details, compares it with the properties of the TTEthernet standard. In particular, we first investigate their clock synchronization algorithms and discuss their shaping and scheduling strategies for traffic types with individual timing requirements. Then we show the impact the hard real-time traffic has on soft real-time traffic and give the worst case end-to-end latency calculation. Finally, we determine whether TSN offers flexibility for the requirements of avionic.

TI  - ImprovingWorst-case TSN Communication Times of Large Sensor Data Samples by Exploiting Synchronization
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Higher levels of automated driving also require a more sophisticated environmental perception. Therefore, an increasing number of sensors transmit their data samples as frame bursts to other applications for further processing. As a vehicle has to react to its environment in time, such data is subject to safety-critical latency constraints. To keep up with the resulting data rates, there is an ongoing transition to a Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)-based communication backbone. However, the use of TSN-related industry standards does not match the automotive requirements of large timely sensor data transmission, nor it offers benefits on timecritical transmissions of single control data packets. By using the full data rate of prioritized IEEE 802.1Q Ethernet, giving time guarantees on large data samples is possible, but with strongly degraded results due to data collision. Resolving such collisions with time-aware shaping comes with significant overhead. Hence, rather than optimizing the parameters of the existing protocol, we propose a system design that synchronizes the transmission times of sensor data samples. This limits network protocol complexity and hardware requirements by avoiding tight time synchronization and time-aware shaping. We demonstrate that individual sensor data samples are transmitted without significant interference, exclusively at full Ethernet data rate. We provide a synchronous event model together with a straightforward response time analysis for synchronous multi-frame sample transmissions. The results show that worst-case latencies of such sample communication, in contrast to non-synchronized approaches, are close to their theoretical minimum as well as to simulative results while keeping the overall network utilization high.

TI  - A Survey of Real-Time Ethernet Modeling and Design Methodologies: From AVB to TSN
T2  - ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of real-time critical systems, the ever-increasing communication data traffic puts forward high-bandwidth and low-delay requirements for communication networks. Therefore, various real-time Ethernet protocols have been proposed, but these protocols are not compatible with each other. The IEEE 802.1 Working Group developed standardized protocols named Audio Video Bridging (AVB) in 2005, and renamed it Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) later. TSN not only adds new features but also retains the original functions of AVB. Proposing real-time Ethernet modeling and design methodologies is the key to meeting high-bandwidth and low-delay communication requirements. This article surveys the modeling from AVB to TSN, mainly including: (1) AVB and TSN modeling; (2) end-to-end delay modeling; (3) real-time scheduling modeling; (4) reliability modeling; and (5) security modeling. Based on these models, this article surveys the recent advances in real-time Ethernet design methodologies from AVB to TSN: (1) end-to-end delay analysis from AVB to TSN; (2) real-time scheduling from AVB to TSN; (3) reliability-aware design for TSN; and (4) security-aware design for TSN. Among the above four points, the last two points are only for TSN, because AVB lacks reliability and security mechanisms. This article further takes the automotive use case as an example to discuss the application of TSN in automobiles. Finally, this article discusses the future trends of TSN. By surveying the recent advances and future trends, we hope to provide references for researchers interested in real-time Ethernet modeling and design methodologies for AVB and TSN.

TI  - Network Calculus-Based Latency for Time-Triggered Traffic under Flexible Window-Overlapping Scheduling (FWOS) in a Time-Sensitive Network (TSN)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Deterministic latency is an urgent demand to pursue the continuous increase in intelligence in several real-time applications, such as connected vehicles and automation industries. A time-sensitive network (TSN) is a new framework introduced to serve these applications. Several functions are defined in the TSN standard to support time-triggered (TT) requirements, such as IEEE 802.1Qbv and IEEE 802.1Qbu for traffic scheduling and preemption mechanisms, respectively. However, implementing strict timing constraints to support scheduled traffic can miss the needs of unscheduled real-time flows. Accordingly, more relaxed scheduling algorithms are required. In this paper, we introduce the flexible window-overlapping scheduling (FWOS) algorithm that optimizes the overlapping among TT windows by three different metrics: the priority of overlapping, the position of overlapping, and the overlapping ratio (OR). An analytical model for the worst-case end-to-end delay (WCD) is derived using the network calculus (NC) approach considering the relative relationships between window offsets for consecutive nodes and evaluated under a realistic vehicle use case. While guaranteeing latency deadline for TT traffic, the FWOS algorithm defines the maximum allowable OR that maximizes the bandwidth available for unscheduled transmission. Even under a non-overlapping scenario, less pessimistic latency bounds have been obtained using FWOS than the latest related works.

AB  - For many Ethernet-based real-time systems, such as those from automotive, avionics, and industry automation domains, fault tolerance is emerged as an essential requirement for enabling fail-safe or fail-operational behavior. Consequently, the IEEE 802.1CB-2017 standard was published. It is currently the only available time-sensitive networking group standard offering protection against transmission errors. It tackles these faults by preventively replicating the frames and transmitting redundant copies via different paths to the destination. However, in contrast to its obvious advantages, the standard contains some pitfalls: most notably, it lacks protection mechanisms against inadequate configurations, which can not only invalidate the intended increase in reliability but even actively jeopardize the safety of the network. Due to the lack of alternative mechanisms, it is crucial to fully understand the fundamental properties of the standard and its implications on the safety aspects of the network traffic. In this letter, we identify critical aspects and limitations of the standard. We demonstrate the risks of inadequate configurations, discuss their ramifications. Finally, we provide an intuition and initial steps toward deriving the formal worst-case timing analysis of the standard, which is a key requirement for its safe and efficient implementation in the aforementioned real-time domains.

TI  - Quantitative Performance Comparison of Various Traffic Shapers in Time-Sensitive Networking
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Owning to the sub-standards being developed by IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group, the traditional IEEE 802.1 Ethernet is enhanced to support real-time dependable communications for future time- and safety-critical applications. Several sub-standards have been recently proposed that introduce various traffic shapers (e.g., Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), Asynchronous Traffic Shaper (ATS), Credit-Based Shaper (CBS), Strict Priority (SP)) for flow control mechanisms of queuing and scheduling, targeting different application requirements. These shapers can be used in isolation or combination and there is limited work that analyzes, evaluates, and compares their performance, which makes it challenging for end-users to choose the right combination for their applications. This paper aims at (i) quantitatively comparing various traffic shapers and their combinations, (ii) summarizing, classifying, and extending the architectures of individual and combined traffic shapers and their Network calculus (NC)-based performance analysis methods, and (iii) filling the gap in the timing analysis research on handling ATS and CBS used for different priority queues, and two novel hybrid architectures of combined traffic shapers, i.e., TAS+ATS+SP and TAS+ATS+CBS when ATS and CBS used at the same queue. A large number of experiments, using both synthetic and realistic test cases, are carried out for quantitative performance comparisons of various individual and combined traffic shapers, from the perspective of upper bounds of delay, backlog, and jitter. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to quantitatively compare the performance of the main traffic shapers in TSN. The paper aims at supporting the researchers and practitioners in the selection of suitable TSN sub-protocols for their use cases.

At present, the research on TSN focuses mainly on how to optimize the scheduling table synthesis to reduce the end-to-end delay of the frame. Routing selection typically uses the common shortest path first (SPF) and weighted shortest path first (wtSPF) algorithms. The path chosen by these algorithms can only ensure a low end-to-end delay of newly added streams, but they cannot guarantee the success rate of scheduling newly added streams or determine whether the delay will have a serious impact on other streams. Therefore, this paper proposes a scheduling routing algorithm for the TSN environment, named Real-Time Routing Scheduler (RTRS), which is applicable to Time-Triggered (TT) streams with immediate constraints. Based on the calculation of the end-to-end maximum delay time, the RTRS is used as a basis for routing to ensure that all TT streams are transmitted within the deadline. The experimental results show that the RTRS algorithm can provide an excellent real-time performance of CPS, improve the scheduling success rate, optimize the maximum end-to-end delay, and ensure that newly added streams do not easily affect the transmission of other streams.

TI  - Critical Offset Optimizations for Overlapping-Based Time-Triggered Windows in Time-Sensitive Network
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deterministic and low latency communications are increasingly becoming essential requirements for several safety-critical applications, such as automotive and automation industries. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an element of the new IEEE 802.1 standards that introduced Ethernet-based amendments to support these applications. One of these enhancements was presented in IEEE 802.1Qbv to define the time-aware shaping (TAS) technique for time-triggered (TT) traffic scheduling. The TAS mechanism is window-based scheduling using a gating system controlled by the gate control list (GCL) schedules in all nodes. Although several scheduling algorithms have been proposed to investigate the effects of window-related parameters on network performance, the offset difference (OD) between the same-class windows in the adjoining nodes has not been optimized yet. These optimizations are extremely crucial to implement less pessimistic latency schedules. This paper proposes an optimized flexible window-overlapping scheduling (OFWOS) algorithm that optimizes TT window offsets based on latency evaluations considering the overlapping between different priority windows at the same node. First, we formulate the GCL timings as mathematical forms under variable ODs between the same-priority windows. Then, an analytical model is implemented using the network calculus (NC) approach to express the worst-case end-to-end delay (WCD) for TT flows and evaluated using a realistic vehicular use case. The OFWOS model optimizes OD under all overlapping situations between TT windows at the same node. Compared with the latest works of 3-hop and 30-hop TSN connections, the OFWOS reduces the WCD bounds by 8.4% and 32.6%, respectively, accomplishing less pessimistic end-to-end latency bounds.

TI  - A Survey on Time-Sensitive Networking: Standards and State-of-the-Art
T2  - Chinese Journal of Computers
M3  - Review
AB  - During the digital transformation process of the society, emerging industry applications with critical data streams present great challenges to current networks. Traditional Ethernet provides best-effort frame delivery service without any performance guarantee such as latency and frame loss. Industrial Ethernet provides real-time and reliable communication services for industrial automation systems. However, the standards of industrial Ethernet are not compatible with each other, and the networking of different industrial systems becomes a great challenge. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) based on Ethernet provides high-quality multi-service flow transmissions on the same network through enhanced functions of time synchronization, deterministic flow scheduling and seamless reliability. It enables high-reliable and bounded low-latency flow transmission services. It is one of the key networking technologies for vertical applications such as industrial automation systems, in-vehicle networking, smart grid, and so on. Firstly, this survey introduces the standardization status of TSN from the following five aspects: time synchronization, low-latency flow control, reliability, network control and management, and use cases. The problems and key technologies of these standards are analyzed. For example,Time synchronization protocols such as NTP (Network Time Protocol),PTP (Precise Time Protocol), and gPTP (generalized PTP) are introduced and compared with a focus on the synchronization algorithms. Different flow scheduling mechanisms covered in the standards are described, analyzed, and compared qualitatively, based on their characteristics and performances. Network redundancy scheme based on the frame replication and elimination for reliability (FRER) is introduced in detail. Three models of TSN control and management are presented. They are centralized model,distributed model, and hybrid model. Vertical applications of TSN are briefly outlined including: professional audio and video,industrial automation, mobile fronthaul,service provider network, in-vehicle networking, and smart grid. Secondly, we survey the research state-of-the-art of TSN with a focus on the advantages and disadvantages of current solutions. Three research areas covered in this survey are time synchronization, flow control, and reliability. The main challenges to time synchronizations are algorithms enabling fast and efficient synchronization process,and clock precision. Current research works on the low-latency flow control mainly focus on traffic shaping, traffic scheduling, and traffic preemption. Traffic shaping problems include delay analysis,shaping mechanism and shaping overhead. Research topics of traffic scheduling include optimization algorithms, joint scheduling of routing and slot allocation, and software defined TSN. Flow preemption research works try to solve the problems of jitter and the adversary effect to the preempted traffic flow. Research works on TSN reliability include redundancy mechanisms,fault detection and restoration,and reliability of time synchronizations. Finally, research challenges and potential research directions are discussed. Future research works include TSN networking, Wireless TSN, and vertical applications of TSN. How to integrate TSN with other network layers remains to be a research problem. Due to the inherent characteristics of wireless channels, design of wireless networks with deterministic properties similar to TSN is a great challenge. Vertical applications of TSN such as 5G fronthaul, industrial automation systems, and in-vehicle networking are envisioned. In a word, TSN is a promising network technology in the fourth industrial revolution of the society.

TI  - Deterministic routing and scheduling method for            time-sensitive networks, involves using offset search            to reserve time slots for service flows while meeting            delay requirement, scheduling business flows passing            through same link and adding scheduled failed flow to            failed flow list and restoring site
AB  - 
                   NOVELTY - The method involves creating a time-sensitive                network model. The fuzzy logic controller is used                to analyze the similarity of flow characteristics                based on the integer splitting theory. The                source-destination pairs of similar and similar                service flows are routed together based on the                Dijkstra algorithm and network topology. The time                sensitive network (TSN) network status is obtained                and the scene is saved before scheduling. The                offset search is used to reserve time slots for                service flows while meeting delay requirements                based on the worst-case delay tolerance of each                hop. The business flows passing through the same                link is seamlessly scheduled. The scheduled failed                flow is added to the failed flow list and the site                is restored.
                    USE - Deterministic routing and scheduling method                for time-sensitive network for improving resource                availability.
                    ADVANTAGE - The method ensures time sensitive flow                deterministic transmission in the time sensitive                network, makes the residual time slot resource more                centralized, so as to improve the usability of the                network residual resources.

AB  - Future autonomous vehicles and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) need real-time audio and video transmission together with control data traffic (CDT). Audio/video stream delay analysis has been largely investigated in AVB (Audio Video Bridging) context, but not yet with the presence of the CDT in the new TSN context. In this paper we present a local delay analysis of AVB frames under hierarchical scheduling of credit-based shaping and time-aware shaping on TSN switches. We present the effects of time aware shaping on AVB traffic, how it changes the relative order of transmission of frames leading to bursts and worst case scenarios for lower priority streams. We also show that these bursts are upper-bounded by the Credit-Bases Shaper, hence the worst-case transmissions delay of a given stream is also upper-bounded. We present the analysis to compute the worst case delay for a frame, as well as the feasibility condition necessary for the analysis to be applied. Our methods (analysis and simulation) are applied to an automotive use case, which is defined within the Eurostars RETINA project, and where both control data traffic and AVB traffic must be guaranteed.

AB  - Industrial automation networks are composed of cyber-physical systems where frame delays and jitter influence significantly the quality of communication between control and field devices. Due to these constraints, such systems are often served by dedicated Fieldbus networks which are different from networks for enterprise-level connectivity. However, with the introduction of Time-sensitive Networking standards which are already integrated into IEEE 802.1Q-2018 standards in essential parts, the long expected single converged network for any-type communication in the field, control, and enterprise level is within reach. With it, comes the challenge of synthesizing schedules to obtain parameters for configuring the network bridges for time-triggered communication services.This paper provides a scheduling verification, and Gate Control event computation algorithm focused on asserting the viability of scheduling communication services for multiple independent periodic Talker applications on IEEE 802.1Q- Time Sensitive Networks as well as the computation of Gate Control Lists for the bridges.

AB  - 
                   NOVELTY - The method involves determining network                topology parameters by a centralized user                configurator (CUC). The traffic information is                sorted according to whether reservation is required                and priority. A network model is established, and a                bandwidth scheduling model is converted in the                network into a system of equations composed of                constraints and objective functions to solve.

The worst-case end-to-end delay of audio and                video bridging (AVB) streams is met, while reducing                the impact of high-priority traffic on AVB                streams.

The scheduling time of the data                frame to be scheduled is determined in the                time-sensitive network, and the determination is                made to check whether the data frame is scheduled                according to the scheduling time before the window                is closed. The data frame is scheduled through the                window in the case that the scheduling is                completed. A constraint condition is set on the                window in the case that the scheduling cannot be                completed, and the data frame is scheduled through                the constraint window. The frame constraint is to                constrain the transmission time of the data frame                in the window, the maximum end-to-end delay                constraint is the maximum time between sending and                receiving the data frame, and the bandwidth                constraint is that windows enough of the bandwidth                used for the data frame.

TI  - Improving Worst-Case Delay Analysis for Traffic of Additional Stream Reservation Class in Ethernet-AVB Network
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increase in the number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and future requirements for vehicle functions, two SR (Stream Reservation) traffic classes may not be sufficient to ensure fulfilment of constraints for multiple traffic types with individual timing requirements transmitted in the Ethernet-AVB (Audio Video Bridging) networks. The goal of this paper is to determine the worst-case delay for an additional SR traffic class under the CBS (Credit-Based Shaper) algorithm. Delay evaluation is based on the impact analysis of CBS on different priority flows, particularly depending on when the credits of both SR class A and B drain from the worst-case perspective. More specifically, both the impact of CBS and the evolution trends of credit on different priority class flows are first analyzed from the worst-case perspective. Then, for an additional SR class, two types of worst-case delay models are established with the CBS configuration suggestions. Finally, an approach to calculate the worst-case queuing delay is proposed. Moreover, the worst-case end-to-end delay is determined by the network calculus approach and simulation. Numerical results show that the delay bounds of our models are tighter than those of other models, which is beneficial to the development of Ethernet-AVB for in-vehicle networking.

TI  - A novel frame preemption model in TSN networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper identifies a limitation in the frame preemption model in the TSN standard (IEEE 802.1Q-2018), due to which high priority frames can experience significantly long blocking delays, thereby exacerbating their worst-case response times. This limitation can have a considerable impact on the design, analysis and performance of TSN-based systems. To address this limitation, the paper presents a novel and more efficient frame preemption model in the TSN standard that allows over 90% reduction in the maximum blocking delay leading to lower worst-case response times of high priority frames compared to the frame preemption model used in the existing works. The paper also shows that the improvement becomes even more significant in multi-switch TSN networks. In order to evaluate the effects of preemption, the paper performs simulations by enabling and disabling preemptions as well as enabling and disabling the Hold/Release mechanism supported by TSN. Furthermore, the paper performs a comparative evaluation of the two models of frame preemption in TSN using simulations. The evaluation shows that the maximum response times of high priority frames can be significantly reduced with very small impact on the response times of lower priority frames. The paper also shows the improvement in the maximum response times of higher priority frames using an automotive industrial use case that employs a multi-hop TSN network for on-board communication.

TI  - Deterministic delay analysis of AVB switched Ethernet networks using an extended Trajectory Approach
T2  - REAL-TIME SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Audio Video Bridging (AVB) switched Ethernet is being considered as a promising network alternative solution for the automotive industry thanks to its high data transmission rate and dedicated bandwidth for real-time traffic. However, guaranteeing deterministic communications of an AVB switched Ethernet network remains a key issue for safety-critical applications in automotive domain. In order to ensure real-time timeliness constraints for any flow sent in AVB switched Ethernet networks, we establish new bounds on the worst-case end-to-end delay of any flow. Our contributions are the following: (i) We first develop a worst-case delay analysis in the context of AVB switched Ethernet network based on an extension of the Trajectory Approach. (ii) Then we take into account serialization constraints on frame transmissions to improve the computation of worst-case end-to-end delay bounds. (iii) Finally, we refine the proposed approach by taking into consideration the AVB traffic shaping characteristics. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated on a set of representative automotive examples.

TI  - Schedulability analysis of Ethernet Audio Video Bridging networks with scheduled traffic support
T2  - REAL-TIME SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The IEEE Audio Video Bridging (AVB) technology is nowadays under consideration in several automation domains, such as, automotive, avionics, and industrial communications. AVB offers several benefits, such as open specifications, the existence of multiple providers of electronic components, and the real-time support, as AVB provides bounded latency to real-time traffic classes. In addition to the above mentioned properties, in the automotive domain, comparing with the existing in-vehicle networks, AVB offers significant advantages in terms of high bandwidth, significant reduction of cabling costs, thickness and weight, while meeting the challenging EMC/EMI requirements. Recently, an improvement of the AVB protocol, called the AVB ST, was proposed in the literature, which allows for supporting scheduled traffic, i.e., a class of time-sensitive traffic that requires time-driven transmission and low latency. In this paper, we present a schedulability analysis for the real-time traffic crossing through the AVB ST network. In addition, we formally prove that, if the bandwidth in the network is allocated according to the AVB standard, the schedulability test based on response time analysis will fail for most cases even if, in reality, these cases are schedulable. In order to provide guarantees based on analysis test a bandwidth over-reservation is required. In this paper, we propose a solution to obtain a minimized bandwidth over-reservation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to formally spot the limitation and to propose a solution for overcoming it. The proposed analysis is applied to both the AVB standard and the AVB ST. The analysis results are compared with the results of several simulative assessments, obtained using OMNeT++, on both automotive and industrial case studies. The comparison between the results of the analysis and the simulation ones shows the effectiveness of the analysis proposed in this work.

AB  - Audio Video Bridging Ethernet (AVB) [1] is a standard developed by IEEE Audio Video Bridging Task Group based on switched-Ethernet. It is used in the automotive domain. AVB includes flow differentiation service using Fixed Priority (FP) policy. It ensures a class level credit based shaping (CBS) for high priority flows in each switch.A guaranteed upper bound on End-to-end (ETE) delays, in such a network, is mandatory for certification purpose. Some methods such as Compositional Performance Analysis (CPA) or Trajectory Approach (TA) have been designed to determine worst-case ETE delays in AVB networks. The Forward end-to-end delay Analysis (FA) has been initially developed for AFDX network for a First In First Out (FIFO) or FP/FIFO scheduling. In this paper, we extend it to take into account the CBS algorithm to cover also AVB networks. Finally, we apply FA on a sample configuration and compare the results to the aforementioned approach CPA.

TI  - Tight Worst-Case Response-Time Analysis for Ethernet AVB using Eligible Intervals
T2  - 2016 IEEE WORLD CONFERENCE ON FACTORY COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS (WFCS)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE World Conference on Factory Communication Systems (WFCS)
CL  - Aveiro, PORTUGAL
AB  - Busy period analysis is often used as a basis for worst-case response time analysis of priority based systems. However, when shaping strategies are used to prevent starvation of lower priorities, it becomes difficult to achieve tightness results using this method. The reason for this is that a busy period is defined as the longest interval in which there exists pending load. It is exclusively based on execution time, and does not take the amount of provided bandwidth into account. As a consequence, it is less suitable for the study of idling systems. In particular, we do not yet have tightness results regarding the analysis of the Ethernet AVB standard, in which credit-based shaping is applied. In this paper, we propose an alternative to the use of busy periods. We show that, by defining an eligible interval in such a way that provisioning is taken into account, tight worst-case response time bounds can more easily be obtained for Ethernet AVB, at least in the case of either lower- or higher-priority interference.

However, several questions pertaining to schedulability of hard realtime messages transmitted via such a switch remain unanswered. In this paper, we attempt to fill this void. We derive equations to perform worst-case response time analysis on Ethernet AVB switches by considering its credit-based shaping algorithm. Also, we propose several approaches to reduce the pessimism in the analysis to provide tighter bounds.

AB  - In the automotive domain, Ethernet Audio Video Bridging (AVB) provides service guarantees for real-time traffic. Its configuration synthesis requires routing the flows and allocating the bandwidth for Credit Based Shaping (CBS). Current approaches typically employ deadline-oblivious bandwidth allocation and rely on routing to establish deadline guarantees. But the worst-case delay of AVB flows requires complex analysis. Thus, routing integrated with the delay analysis either supports limited Stream Reservation (SR) classes or suffers significant timing overhead. To enable efficient run-time flow setup, we propose SynAVB, a tool to synthesize the configuration of Ethernet AVB, which establishes deadline awareness in bandwidth allocation. SynAVB supports an arbitrary number of SR classes and processes them one by one. For the flows in an SR class, it first performs a deadline-oblivious routing based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to guarantee the necessary bandwidth required by the flows. Then, a deadline-aware slope allocation algorithm computes the bandwidth required on every link to satisfy the deadline of all flows. Our experiment demonstrates that, given the same routes, the deadline-aware bandwidth allocation results in fewer flows violating the deadline compared with other allocation strategies. Moreover, SynAVB can guarantee the deadline of more flows while its run-time is up to 14.3x faster than the state-of-the-art approaches.

TI  - Access mechanism for period flows of non-deterministic end systems for time-sensitive networks
T2  - COMPUTER NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - The IEEE 802.1Qbv standard schedules time-triggered (TT) flows (i.e., period flows) in a fixed TT Window each period. However,period flows generated by non-deterministic end systems exhibit significant jitter, whichleads to a mismatch between the generation times and the scheduled TT Windows. In the worst case scenario, this mismatch can cause an additional send delay of approximately one period in the flow. In this study,we model the send delay issue due to the maximum send delay requirement for all frames in a period flow not being satisfied simultaneously, and measure the jitter of period flows in a typical non-deterministic end system. Moreover, we propose an access mechanism for jittered period flows to schedule multiple conflict-free TT Windows in each period of flows at the source end system and control the send delay within the required delay tolerance. This mechanism enables deterministic access to jittered period flows, providing a prerequisite for reliable end-to-end transmission in the network. Moreover, this mechanism adopts a multi-objective integer linear programming (MILP) solver to optimize the TT Windows schedule. Furthermore, we establish the constraints and objective functions for the MILP solver and evaluate the mechanism with actual sampled frames in a real non-deterministic end system. Compared with the conventional fixed single TT Window and worst-case delay analysis mechanisms, the proposed mechanism satisfies the send delay requirements and considerably reduces the buffer usage at the source end system.

TI  - Calculation Method for Maximum Time Delay of Substation Communication Network Based on Time-sensitive Networking
T2  - Automation of Electric Power Systems
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the communication requirements of IEC 61850 smart substation services and the basic principle of timesensitive networking (TSN), TSN technology is applied to ensure the real-time characteristic of substation communication services. The information flow service curve is established based on the switch forwarding principle of the TSN flow scheduling protocol IEEE 802.1Qbv. Based on the packet transmission characteristics of the substation communication network, the arrival curve of the information source is established, and a calculation method of the end-to-end maximum time delay of the substation packet transmission is proposed by using the network calculus theory. Through the simulation analysis of different levels of substation communication network, the results show that TSN technology meets the communication requirement of substation services, especially in ensuring the real-time transmission of time-sensitive services such as key control commands. The proposed maximum time delay calculation method provides a theoretical calculation basis for time delay analysis of applying TSN to smart substations.

AB  - Existing papers on worst-case response time analysis for individual classes in Ethernet AVB typically focus on classes under credit-based shaping (CBS). There also exist industrial applications that use the Best-Effort class BE for non-hard real-time traffic with a minimum quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, however. In this paper, we therefore present a conjecture for worst-case response time analysis for that class BE, stating that the existing analysis based on eligible intervals can be equally well applied to a single (highest-priority) stream without CBS, by simply assuming the remaining bandwidth to be available to that stream. The conjecture is illustrated using a figure.

AB  - Machine learning (ML), and supervised learning in particular, can be used to learn what makes it hard for a network to be feasible and try to predict whether a network configuration will be feasible without executing a conventional schedulability analysis. A disadvantage of ML-based timing verification with respect to schedulability analysis is the possibility of "false positives": configurations deemed feasible while they are not. In this work, in order to minimize the rate of false positives, we propose the use of a measure of the uncertainty of the prediction to drop it when the uncertainty is too high, and rely instead on schedulability analysis. In this hybrid verification strategy, the clear-cut decisions are taken by ML, while the more difficult ones are taken by a conventional schedulability analysis. Importantly, the trade-off achieved between prediction accuracy and computing time can be controlled. We apply this hybrid verification method to Ethernet TSN networks and obtain, for instance in the case of priority scheduling with 8 traffic classes, a 99% prediction accuracy with a speedup factor of 5.7 with respect to conventional schedulability analysis and a reduction of 46% of the false positives compared to ML alone.

TI  - Cost of Robustness of independent WCRT analysis for CBS of Ethernet AVB using eligible intervals

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE 19th International Workshop on Factory Communication Systems (WFCS)
CL  - Pavia, ITALY
AB  - The existing worst-case response time (WCRT) analysis for individual priority classes under credit-based shaping (CBS) in Ethernet AVB based on so-called eligible intervals is both independent and tight. This WCRT analysis does not rely on any assumptions on interfering inter-priority streams other than those enforced by the Ethernet standard. A major advantage of this independent analysis is that CBS may be viewed as resource reservation, where allocated bandwidth is both guaranteed and enforced. Although independent analysis provides inter-priority class robustness, it comes at a cost of over-provisioning bandwidth. We illustrate this cost of inter-priority class robustness by means of an example that requires 7.8 times the amount of bandwidth reservation for a given set of streams compared to a different analysis that takes knowledge of interpriority streams into account.

TI  - Time-Sensitive Networking in automotive embedded systems: State of the art and research opportunities
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The functionality advancements and novel customer features that are currently found in modern automotive systems require high-bandwidth and low-latency in-vehicle communications, which become even more compelling for autonomous vehicles. In a recent effort to meet these requirements, the IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group has developed a set of standards that introduce novel features in Switched Ethernet. TSN standards offer, for example, a common notion of time through accurate and reliable clock synchronization, delay bounds for real-time traffic, time-driven transmissions, improved reliability, and much more. In order to fully utilize the potential of these novel protocols in the automotive domain, TSN should be seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art and state-of-practice model-based development processes for automotive embedded systems. Some of the core phases in these processes include software architecture modeling, timing predictability verification, simulation, and hardware realization and deployment. Moreover, throughout the development of automotive embedded systems, the safety and security requirements specified on these systems need to be duly taken into account. In this context, this work provides an overview of TSN in automotive applications and discusses the recent technological developments relevant to the adoption of TSN in automotive embedded systems. The work also points at the open challenges and future research directions.

AB  - In this work, we ask if Machine Learning (ML) can provide a viable alternative to conventional schedulability analysis to determine whether a real-time Ethernet network meets a set of timing constraints. Otherwise said, can an algorithm learn what makes it difficult for a system to be feasible and predict whether a configuration will be feasible without executing a schedulability analysis? To get insights into this question, we apply a standard supervised ML technique, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and compare its accuracy and running times against precise and approximate schedulability analyses developed in Network-Calculus. The experiments consider different TSN scheduling solutions based on priority levels combined for one of them with traffic shaping. The results obtained on an automotive network topology suggest that k-NN is efficient at predicting the feasibility of realistic TSN networks, with an accuracy ranging from 91.8% to 95.9% depending on the exact TSN scheduling mechanism and a speedup of 190 over schedulability analysis for 10(6) configurations. Unlike schedulability analysis, ML leads however to a certain rate "false positives" (i.e., configurations deemed feasible while they are not). Nonetheless ML-based feasibility assessment techniques offer new trade-offs between accuracy and computation time that are especially interesting in contexts such as design-space exploration where false positives can be tolerated during the exploration process.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2nd International Symposium on Dependable Software Engineering - Theories, Tools and Applications (SETTA)

AB  - Schedulability analysis is one of the most important issues in developing and analyzing real-time systems. Given a task system where each task is characterized by a worst-case execution time (WCET) and a relative deadline, the schedulability analysis is decidable. However in reality, it is difficult to calculate the WCET of a complex task, even after it is abstracted to a formal model, e.g., timed automata (TAs). This paper proposes a schedulability analysis method without the information of the WCET, by introducing a model named timed regular task automata (TRTAs). Each task is described by a TA, a starting point with a clock valuation, a status and a relative deadline. A test is performed on each TA for an under-approximation of the WCET. The system may still be unschedulable under the approximation. A further schedulability checking is then performed by encoding to the reachability problem of nested timed automata (NeTAs). The methodology is thus sound and complete.

AB  - This paper proposes an approach to model switched Ethernet communication within a model- and component-based software development framework for vehicular distributed embedded systems. The paper also presents a method to extract the network timing model from the systems that use switched Ethernet networks. In order to provide a proof of concept, an existing industrial component model and its tool suite, namely RCM and Rubus-ICE respectively, are extended by implementing the modeling technique, the timing model extraction method and response-time analysis of the Ethernet AVB protocol. The extensions to RCM are backward compatible with the modeling and end-to-end timing analysis of traditional in-vehicle networks and legacy (previously developed) vehicular distributed embedded systems. Furthermore, the paper discusses the implementation and test strategy used in this work. Finally, the usability of the modeling approach and implemented timing analysis is demonstrated by modeling and time analyzing a vehicular application case study with the extended component model and tool suite.

AB  - Industrial automation is changing towards a flat and highly interconnected architecture, with requirements for end-to-end real-time enabled machine-to-machine communications. Technologies such as time-sensitive networking (TSN) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) publish-subscribe provide the necessary features. While TSN is well explored, OPC UA's execution time behavior remains unknown. This article presents findings made while extending the open62541 OPC UA PubSub stack with the 802.1q VLAN tag to enable IEEE 802.1Qbv time-aware scheduling. The results include end-to-end timing measures and worst-case execution time analyses considering various payloads. Time-predictable T-CREST platforms host the publisher and subscriber, and a TSN network handles message transmission. The paper concludes by outlining further research focusing on dynamic memory access, buffer management, and the inclusion of non-priority access to the Ethernet port.

We describe the latency of Audio Video Bridge (AVB) network as well as purpose the optimized design of the Ethernet network system for automotive. Our design plays a significant role in reducing the delay between components. The proposed approach on realistic test cases showed that there was a delay reduction, approximately 49.4%. It is expected that the optimization method for the actual automotive environment can greatly shorten the time period in the design and development process. The results obtained from the experiments on the delay time present in each function are reliable because average values are obtained through repeated actual tests for several months. It will greatly benefit the industry since analyzing the latency between each function in a short period of time is very important.

AB  - A delay mathematical model was constructed,which combined the classical AVB (Audio/Video Bridge)protocol model and QLearning with the objective of AVB switch's data to improve the compactness of AVB data delay analysis results.Based on the study of the AVB protocol model and Qreinforcement learning theory,a more practical forwarding strategy was proposed for AVB switch data.The delay of each frame and the average delay of all types of traffic were analyzed based on factors influencing the data forwarding delay of automotive Ethernet.To verify the correctness of the established mathematical model,a simulation test bench of automotive Ethernet was built by combining Intrepid's RAD_Galaxy and the samples of the surround view system,and the experimental results were compared and analyzed based on Wireshark analysis.The simulation of the surround view system and the testing results of simulation test bench indicate the following:under a given condition,the average delay of class A flow is 41.36mus,and the maximum deviation is 3.17%;the average delay of class BE flow is 103.53mus,and the maximum deviation is 2.01%;the average delay of class BE flow is 141.99 mus,and the maximum deviation is 3.14%.At the same time,under different loads of BE flow, the delay performances of all types of data are also different.When the link load increases,the average delay of A and B data frames also increases,whereas the average delay of BE data frames does not change significantly.However,when the load exceeds the bandwidth,the average delay of the BE data frames becomes very large.That is,the protocol guarantees the transmission quality of data frames A and B.In addition,the maximum deviation of the delay analysis based on this mathematical model of the simulation test bench is 3.11%,which verifies the reliability of the mathematical model.Therefore,the model can effectively evaluate and guide improvements in network performance.

AB  - In the automotive industry, Ethernet is currently being introduced as a viable solution for real-time communication with high bandwidth requirements. In this paper, we present and prove a tight bound for the relative best-case response time of a frame in an Ethernet AVB switch compared to its response time in a schedule without interference. Our analysis is based on the observation that frames in a burst, scheduled using a credit shaping policy, may be scheduled earlier in case of interference than in a schedule without interference. We show how an upper bound on the build up of credit may be used to bound this relative speed-up of frames.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is becoming more important in automotive and industrial sectors. There is no clear strategy how to use TSN to improve and migrate the established real-time protocols without excluding legacy devices. This paper presents a realistic concept to integrate TSN into automation networks. We choose Sercos as a deterministic Industrial-Ethernet protocol to be extended with the TSN Standards IEEE 802.1AS-Rev and IEEE 802.1Qbv. By simulating the Sercos over TSN network, we investigate the impact of integrating a TSN-capable switch in a Sercos network to enable a topology extension from line/ring to star/tree. By comparing the impact of: increasing the data rate and topology extension, we demonstrate the improvement of Industrial-Ethernet timing performance.

AB  - A homogeneous avionic communication architecture based on the AFDX supporting mixed-criticality applications will bring significant advantages, i.e., easier maintenance and reduced costs. To cope with this emerging issue, the AFDX may integrate multiple traffic classes: Safety-Critical Traffic (SCT) with hard real-time constraints, Rate-Constrained (RC) traffic requiring bounded latencies and Best Effort (BE) traffic with no delivery constraints. These traffic classes are managed based on a Non-Preemptive Strict Priority (NP-SP) Scheduler, where the highest priority traffic (SCT) is shaped with a Burst Limiting Shaper (BLS). The latter has been defined by the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group to limit the impact of high priority flows on lower priority ones. This paper proposes a Network Calculus-based approach to compute the end-to-end delay bounds of SCT and RC classes. We consider the impact of the BLS and the multi-hop network architecture. We also provide proofs of service curves guaranteed to SCT and RC classes, needed to derive delay bounds with Network Calculus. The proposed approach is evaluated on a realistic AFDX configuration. Results show the efficiency of incorporating the TSN/BLS on top of a NP-SP scheduler in the AFDX to noticeably enhance the RC delay bounds while guaranteeing the SCT deadline, in comparison to an AFDX implementing only a NP-SP scheduler.

TI  - Worst-case traversal time analysis of TSN with multi-level preemption
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve low latency transmission of time-sensitive flows in Ethernet networks, the IEEE introduced the IEEE 802.1Qbu Standard, which specifies a 1-level preemption scheme for IEEE 802.1 networks. The specification allows the suspension of a preemptable frame prior to its completion for the speedy transmission of an express frame; but any other preemptable frame cannot be transmitted before the completion of the already preempted frame. While this approach improves the performance of express frames, the performance is negatively impacted in scenarios where the number of express frames is high. Another limitation is the fact that preemptable frames with timing requirements can suffer long blocking periods due to the non-preemptive service of frames in the same category. This is irrespective of the individual priority level of each frame. Recently, a multi-level preemption scheme has been proposed to circumvent these limitations. The work focused on the feasibility and implementation requirement of such an approach, but a formal analysis of the worst-case performance guarantees under the proposed scheme was not provided. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting the aforementioned analysis of the TSN IEEE 802.1Qbu networks under the multi-level preemption assumption. Evaluation is performed with a realistic automotive use-case and the results showcase an improvement up to 53.07% for preemptable frames with firm timing requirements.To achieve low latency transmission of time-sensitive flows in Ethernet networks, the IEEE introduced the IEEE 802.1Qbu Standard, which specifies a 1-level preemption scheme for IEEE 802.1 networks.

AB  - One of the key challenges in future Ethernet-based automotive and industrial networks is the low-latency transport of time-critical data. To date, Ethernet frames are sent non-preemptively. This introduces a major source of delay, as, in the worst-case, a latency-critical frame might be blocked by a frame of lower priority, which started transmission just before the latency-critical frame. The upcoming IEEE 802.3br standard will introduce Ethernet frame preemption to address this problem. While high-priority traffic benefits from preemption, lower-priority (yet still latency-sensitive) traffic experiences a certain overhead, impacting its timing behavior. In this paper, we present a formal timing analysis for Ethernet to derive worst-case latency bounds under preemption. We use a realistic automotive Ethernet setup to analyze the worst-case performance of standard Ethernet and Ethernet TSN under preemption and also compare our results to non-preemptive implementations of these standards.

TI  - Improving Latency Analysis for Flexible Window-Based GCL Scheduling in TSN Networks by Integration of Consecutive Nodes Offsets
T2  - IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an upcoming set of Ethernet standards designed for real-time and safety-critical Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications in automotive, aerospace, and industrial automation domains. With the combination, complexity, and flexibility of flow control mechanisms in TSN connected systems, the performance analysis for mixed-critical messages is becoming a difficult challenge. The flexible window-based gate control list (GCL) scheduling model has been proposed as a relaxation to assumptions on frames-to-window allocation, mutually exclusive gates opening, and scheduled end systems and switches, which offers more flexibility in the configuration of GCLs. In this article, we are interested in providing a reliable verification method based on the network calculus theory to drive GCL configurations for TSN networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first performance analysis method suitable for the general flexible window-based GCLs in entire TSN networks, by reflecting the relative positional relationships of windows for same priority queues on consecutive nodes and constructing the window limitations into the shaper curve, in order to reduce the pessimism of the latency bounds. We validate the proposed method through Industrial IoT synthetics test cases and two large realistic cases, showing the significant reduction in pessimism on delay bounds, and the correctness and scalability by comparing with results from the previous work and simulation results.

TI  - Independent WCRT analysis for individual priority classes in Ethernet AVB
T2  - REAL-TIME SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the high-tech and automotive industry, bandwidth considerations and widely accepted standardization are two important reasons why Ethernet is currently being considered as an alternative solution for real-time communication (compared to traditional fieldbusses). Although Ethernet was originally not intended for this purpose, the development of the Ethernet AVB standard enables its use for transporting high-volume data (e.g. from cameras and entertainment applications) with low-latency guarantees. In complex industrial systems, the network is shared by many applications, developed by different parties. To face this complexity, the development of these applications must be kept as independent as possible. In particular, from a network point of view, progress of all communication streams must be guaranteed, and the performance for individual streams should be predictable using only information regarding the stream under study and the general parameters of the communication standard used by the network. Initial methods to guarantee latency for Ethernet AVB networks rely on the traditional busy-period analysis. Typically, these methods are based on knowledge of the inter-arrival patterns of both the stream under study and the interfering streams that also traverse the network. The desired independence is therefore not achieved. In this paper, we present an independent real-time analysis based on so-called eligible intervals, which does not rely on any assumptions on interfering priority classes other than those enforced in the Ethernet AVB standard. We prove this analysis is tight in case there is only a single higher-priority stream, and no additional information on interference is known. In case there are multiple higher-priority streams, we give conditions under which the analysis is still tight. Furthermore, we compare the results of our approach to the two most recent busy-period analyses, point out sources of pessimism in these earlier works, and argue that assuming more information on the sources of interference (e.g. a minimal inter-arrival time between interfering frames) has only limited advantages.

Although Ethernet was originally not intended for this purpose, the development of the Ethernet AVB standard enables its use for transporting high-volume data (e.g. from cameras and entertainment applications) with latency guarantees.The traditional busy-period analysis that ensures these latency guarantees relies on knowledge of all data streams, including interference. However, for complex industrial systems, the assumption that characteristics of all interfering data streams are known, is not realistic. As the amount of components connected to an Ethernet network grows, it becomes less likely that one can know or enforce the traffic patterns generated by all these components.In this paper, we present an independent real-time analysis based on so-called eligible intervals, which does not rely on any assumptions on interfering priority classes other than those enforced in the Ethernet AVB standard. We prove our analysis is tight when no additional information on interference is known. Furthermore, we compare the results of our approach to the two most recent busy-period analyses, point out sources of pessimism in these earlier works, and discuss the advantages of using eligible-intervals over busy-period analysis when studying idling servers.

AB  - In this paper we discuss the challenges that are faced when the state-of-the-art research results are transferred to a model-based tool chain for the industrial use. These challenges are often overlooked when the research results are implemented in an academic environment. In particular, we discuss various challenges regarding the implementation and integration of the response-time analysis for heterogeneous networks, comprising of CAN and Ethernet AVB, as a plug-in for the Rubus Analysis Framework. Rubus tool suite is used for the model- and component-based development of software for vehicular real-time systems by several international companies. We also discuss preliminary solutions to deal with the challenges.

TI  - Validity of a novel device for real-time analysis of cyclists' drag area
T2  - JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE IN SPORT
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To assess the reliability, validity, and sensitivity of a novel device (Notio Konect (TM)) which is purported to provide a real-time analysis of aerodynamic drag area (CdA) during cycling.Design: Observational, cross-sectional study.Methods: Fifteen trained cyclists rode in an indoor velodrome using three different positions (upright, aero [holding aero bars], and optimized aero [similar to aero, but wearing a time-trial helmet]). They completed six 1-min trials in each position. The CdA was measured with Notio and with two other systems (Track Aero System (TM) [TAS] and a validated mathematical model).Results: The CdA measured with Notio showed good reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.92, 90% confidence interval [CI]=0.89-0.95). Notio showed an almost perfect relationship with both TAS (ICC= 0.99, 90% CI = 0.98-0.99) and the mathematical model (ICC= 0.99, 90% CI = 0.98-0.99). However, the CdA values provided by the former (0.308 +/- 0.051 m(2)) were significantly higher (albeit with a trivial effect size [ES]) compared with TAS (0.300+0.051 m(2), p < 0.001, ES= 0.15) and the mathematical model (0.303 +/- 0.051 m(2), p = 0.005, ES = 0.09). The CdA was higher in the upright than in the aero position with all systems (all p< 0.001, ES= 1.84-1.89), and higher in the aero than in the optimized aero position when measured with TAS (p = 0.033, ES= 0.22) or the mathematical model (p= 0.024, ES= 0.24), but not with Notio (p = 0.220, ES= 0.19).Conclusions: Notio appears to be reliable, strongly correlated to other established systems, and discerns large (upright vs aero) but not small (aero vs optimized aero)variations in riding position. Further research is needed to confirm its validity in outdoor conditions. (C) 2019 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Very large scale integrated chip design optimizing method, involves performing two timing analysis on netlist, and bounding negative slack elimination that is applied to current state of netlist timing
AB  - 
                   NOVELTY - The method involves performing two timing analysis (TAs) on a netlist, where one analysis enables modification of an environment of another TA to create a realistic environment in which a netlist transformation is applied and measured. A constraint is formed by transferring an output of the latter TA to the former TA. Best transformation is determined, and applied to a current state of the netlist timing by dynamically eliminating a maximum negative slack. The negative slack elimination applied to the current state of the netlist timing is bounded.
                    USE - Method for optimizing a very large scale integrated chip (VLSI) design represented by a netlist.
                    ADVANTAGE - The method enables elimination of the negative timing slack in a very large scale integrated chip, thus ensuring proper functionality of the chip. design. The method enables provision of upper bounds on the negative slack elimination to prevent the netlist transforms from being applied to situations exceeding capabilities for improving the design. The method enables efficient improvement in the timing of a very large scale integrated chip (VLSI) chip design, during placement and synthesis. The method allows a design process to be implemented at high speed by eliminating wasted time, and enables provision of accurate information regarding design quality. The method avoids the design from reaching zero or a positive slack by generating the guidelines throughout the process.
                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:(1) an article of manufacture for performing a method for optimizing a design represented by a netlist(2) a program storage device comprising a set of instructions for performing a method for optimizing a design represented by a netlist.
                    DESCRIPTION Of DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flow diagram of a method for optimizing a very large scale integrated chip design.

TI  - Outage Probability Performance Analysis and Prediction for Mobile IoV Networks Based on ICS-BP Neural Network
T2  - IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the field of transportation, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an important component of the Internet of Things. The vehicle-to-vehicle communication is particularly challenging in mobile IoV networks because they are operated in complex and highly variable environments. The mobile IoV transmission interruption level can be evaluated by the outage probability (OP) performance. If the OP performance can be analyzed and predicted accurately, the Quality of Service (QoS) in the mobile IoV networks can be improved. However, the analysis and prediction of mobile IoV transmission channels is very challenging because they are highly dynamic. In this article, the analysis and prediction of the OP performance for mobile IoV networks are investigated. A hybrid decode-amplify-forward (HDAF) relaying scheme with transmit antenna selection (TAS) is considered. The exact OP expressions are derived in a closed form, and the analytical results are verified. To realize the real-time analysis of the OP performance, an intelligent OP prediction algorithm based on the improved cuckoo search (ICS) is presented. The proposed algorithm is compared with different methods and the results show that it has a better OP prediction performance. The prediction accuracy of ICS-BP can be increased by 51.8% compared with the existing algorithms.

TI  - How Smart Grid Meets In Vitro Meat: on Visions as Socio-Epistemic Practices
T2  - NANOETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The production, manipulation and exploitation of future visions are increasingly important elements in practices of visioneering socio-technical processes of innovation and transformation. This becomes obvious in new and emerging science and technologies and large-scale transformations of established socio-technical systems (e.g. the energy system). A variety of science and technology studies (STS) provide evidence on correlations between expectations and anticipatory practices with the dynamics of such processes of change. Technology assessment (TA) responded to the challenges posed by the influence of visions on the processes by elaborating methodologies for a "vision assessment" as a contribution to what is now increasingly known as "hermeneutical TA". But until now, the practical functions of visions in the processes have not been explained in a way that satisfies the empirical needs of TA's vision assessment-that is to provide future-oriented knowledge based on the analysis of ongoing changes in the present without knowing the future outcomes. Our leading hypothesis is that we can only understand the practical roles of visions in current processes if we analyse them as socio-epistemic practices which simultaneously produce new knowledge and enable new social arrangements. We elaborate this by means of two cases: the visions of In Vitro meat and of the smart grid. Here, we interpret visioneering more in its collective dimension as a contingent and open-ended process, emerging from heterogeneous socio-epistemic practices. This paper aims at improving TA's vision assessments and related STS research on visionary practices for real-time analysis and assessments.
