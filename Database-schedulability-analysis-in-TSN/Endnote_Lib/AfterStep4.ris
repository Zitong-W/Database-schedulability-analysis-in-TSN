AB  - With the advent of Industry 4.0 and the popularization of smart terminal equipment, the interaction between industrial field information systems and production equipment has intensified. To meet the real-time transmission of time-triggered flow and the coordinated transmission of best effort flow, time-sensitive network-related technologies are used to implement flow queue forwarding by strictly following the gate control list. First, response-time analysis method is proposed to predict the upper bound of delay under a scheduling model following IEEE 802.1Qbv. Second, according to response-time analysis, a deadline monotonic scheduling algorithm with temporary priority expansion is proposed to divide the priority into more levels, which is not limited by the queue type, so as to ameliorate the transmission sequence of switch export flow. Finally, an adaptive priority adjustment scheduling algorithm with temporary priority expansion is designed to construct the optimal scheduling method further improving the scheduling success rate and reducing worst-case end-to-end delays. Compared with similar algorithms, the algorithm proposed improves the scheduling success rate by at least 30%, reduces the total delay by at least 21% and the TT flow delay by 11% in high network utilization conditions.

AB  - At present, Time-Sensitive Networking has attracted extensive attention in automatic driving, Industrial 4.0, 5G and so on. TSN is used to guarantee the real-time transmission of critical traffic with bounded delay, which is realized by a variety of traffic scheduling mechanisms. One important mechanism of research is Time Aware Shaper mechanism, but current researches on this mechanism usually have the following problems: (a) It takes a long time to get the solution of the algorithm; (b) It’s difficult to schedule burst traffic and the algorithm depends on time synchronization; (c) There is a waste of bandwidth. The core idea of TAS mechanism is time division multiplexing, and the solution of transmission time is the key of traffic scheduling. This paper proposes an adaptive scheduling algorithm based on TAS to avoid above problems. First, the worst-case scheduling problem of actual traffic is seen as the scheduling problem of continuous traffic, and the transmission time of continuous traffic of the worst-case delay is analyzed; Second, the concept of queue scheduling is proposed to optimize scheduling, which achieves the adaptive scheduling of actual traffic, does not depend on time synchronization, and improve bandwidth utilization; Finally, the worst-case delay of the algorithm in actual traffic scheduling is analyzed.

AB  - The selection of a Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) shaping mechanism is a crucial design decision that impacts the Quality of Service (QoS) of applications and configuration complexity. However, current research has mainly evaluated TSN shapers individually, despite them being designed to work together in an egress port. Hence, the lack of investigation of the mixed TSN shaping mechanism is a major limitation of the current state of the art. Combined TSN traffic shaping provides greater flexibility to improve QoS than individual shapers, making it particularly beneficial for real-time applications. This paper aims to bridge this research gap by implementing the Asynchronous Traffic Shaper (ATS) in a plug-and-play manner, enabling its use individually or in combination with other TSN shapers. We propose various models of mixed TSN shaper architectures and implement the frozen and non-frozen credit behavior of the Time Aware Shaper (TAS) + Credit Based Shaper (CBS) during the guard band (GB) using OMNeT++. Furthermore, we compare the simulation results of ATS and CBS with the Network Calculus (NC) upper bounds. Our results indicate that the simulated delays (SMDs) were significantly lower than the theoretical worst-case delays (WCDs) obtained from the NC, indicating the need for tighter theoretical upper bounds, particularly for higher network loads. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide simulation-based performance analysis of the combined $\text{TAS}+\text{ATS}+\text{CBS}$ and $\text{TAS}+\text{ATS}+\text{Strict}$ Priority (SP) architecture. Overall, this paper highlights the benefits of combining TSN shapers and encourages further research into the potential advantages of utilizing multiple shapers simultaneously to decrease reliance on TAS and CBS.

AB  - Time Sensitive Network (TSN) is an attractive solution for time-critical frame transmission in data link layer. Traffic scheduling and shaping in TSN aim to achieve bounded low latency and zero congestion loss. TSN provides traditional frame switching with reliable Quality-of-Service (QoS) parameters, however, synchronization challenges, e.g. jitter, lost timing frames, clock inaccuracy, threaten the reliability of TSN network. Emerging Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) guarantees determinism for real-time applications, e.g. automotive and industrial control, while removing the dependence on synchronous communication. This paper focuses on performance evaluation of the recently proposed ATS amendment to the IEEE 802.1 standard, two approaches are discussed: Urgency-Based Scheduler (UBS) and Paternoster policing and scheduling. Models and simulations are carried out for evaluation and comparison. Statistics on the end-to-end delay, buffer usage and frame loss rate are collected to assess the scheduling performance. Results show that ATS achieves effective traffic shaping and switching without synchronous mechanisms, while there is an evident trade-off for using these specific algorithms.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Ethernet is becoming a primary industrial networking technology, since it provides bounded latency capability with broad reaching ecosystem, supporting both real-time communications and non-time-critical communications in a factory. In TSN, QoS-based shaping is a core technology to provide bounded latency. Network calculus is a theory which aims at worst-case performance analysis in the network. In the paper, latency upper bound of TSN for industrial automation scenario is analyzed based on Network Calculus. Credit-based Shaping (CBS) combined with Strict Priority (SP) is used as the specific QoS-based shaping mechanism of TSN. Relating factors that influence the latency upper bound of TSN are also studied.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is an emerging network technique used in real-time communication. There are three typical traffic types in TSN: Time-Triggered (TT) traffic with strict time stability requirements, Audio-Video-Bridging (AVB) traffic with large bandwidth and bounded latency requirements, and Best-Effort (BE) traffic. This paper presents an analytical latency model for AVB traffic in TSN considering TT traffic. According to the time-slots of TT traffic, an accurate single-hop service curve for AVB traffic is established based on Network Calculus, from which a more precise queueing delay through one hop can be calculated. Moreover, a strict worst-case end-to-end latency of AVB traffic can be obtained by the calculated queueing delays. We evaluate the proposed model in a real network environment, and the results show that the proposed model is more accurate and more accordance with actual circumstance compared with other methods.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is expected to be a cornerstone in tomorrow's industrial networks. That is because of its ability to provide deterministic quality-of-service in terms of delay, jitter, and scalability. Moreover, it enables more scalable, more affordable, and easier to manage and operate networks compared to current industrial networks, which are based on Industrial Ethernet. In this article, we evaluate the maximum capacity of the asynchronous TSN networks to accommodate industrial traffic flows. To that end, we formally formulate the Flow Allocation Problem (FAP) in the mentioned networks as a convex mixed-integer non-linear program. To the best of the authors' knowledge, neither the maximum utilization of the asynchronous TSN networks nor the formulation of the FAP in those networks have been previously addressed in the literature. The results show that the network topology and the traffic matrix highly impact on the link utilization.

AB  - IEEE 802.1 time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a set of amendments to the IEEE 802.1 standard that enable safety-critical and real-time behavior over Ethernet for the industrial automation and automotive domains. Selected TSN mechanisms offer the possibility to emulate the well-known traffic classes found in mixed-criticality distributed systems: Time-triggered (TT) communication with low jitter and bounded endto-end latency, audio-video-bridging (AVB) streams with bounded end-to-end latency, and general besteffort messages, which have no timing guarantees. Critical traffic is guaranteed via the global network schedule which is stored in so-called gate control lists (GCLs) and controls the timely behavior of frames for each queue of an egress port. Although researchers have started to propose approaches for the routing and scheduling (i.e., GCL synthesis) of TT traffic, all previous research has ignored lower priority realtime traffic, such as AVB, resulting in TT configurations that may increase the worst-case delays of AVB traffic, rendering it unschedulable. In this paper, we propose a joint routing and scheduling approach for TT traffic, which takes into account the AVB traffic, such that both TT and the AVB traffic are schedulable. We extensively evaluate our approach on a number of synthetic and realistic test cases.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) evolves from Ethernet AVB in which the Credit-Based Shaping (CBS) is employed to guarantee the deterministic transmission of traffic. In CBS, the real-time performance of traffic associated with the credits can practicably settle the uncertainty of queueing and forwarding for stream-reservation traffic. Hence, the optimization of bandwidth allocation under the CBS becomes a key point to ensure guaranteed performance in the network. In this paper, a bandwidth allocation method is proposed for stream-reservation traffic while the real-time requirements are satisfied. We first illustrate the significance of appropriate bandwidth allocation for traffic under the CBS and construct a general schema for its bandwidth allocation. Also, the influences of the protected window for Control Data Traffic (CDT) on stream-reservation traffic are considered in our method. Further, mathematical models are constructed to analyze the delay bounds and backlogs of traffic to form the feedback for the optimal bandwidth allocation process. Finally, two node-level cases with different bandwidth utilization and a synthetic industrial networking scenario are carried out to demonstrate our method. The results confirm that the excessive reserved bandwidth does not necessarily decrease the delay bound, especially under the high traffic loads scenario. A more desirable bandwidth allocation strategy under the CBS mechanism is that the reserved bandwidth should be just enough according to the traffic loads to ensure the deterministic transmission of traffic.

AB  - In this paper, we present a bandwidth reservation analysis for Audio-Video Bridging (AVB) traffic in the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards. The proposed analysis is based on the existing worst-case response-time analysis and can be used to calculate the minimum required bandwidth for guaranteeing the schedulability of messages in AVB classes. The proposed analysis allocates per-link bandwidth to AVB traffic that is sufficient to ensure its schedulability when a combination of the Credit-Based Shaper and Time-Aware Shaper mechanisms are used. We evaluate the proposed analysis using an automotive industrial use case. We evaluate the schedulability of AVB traffic by comparing the proposed analysis with the utilization-based bandwidth reservation as recommended by the TSN standards.

AB  - With the increasing popularity of time-sensitive network applications and the gradual integration of the Tactile Internet into people’s lives, how to ensure ultra-low latency has become a demand and challenge for network performance. Therefore, it is extremely important to analyze the performance of the Tactile Internet. In this paper, we propose an analytical model based on deterministic network calculus (DNC) to quantitatively derive the end-to-end performance bounds of the Tactile Internet, develop a tandem model describing the communication of the Tactile Internet network, and analyze delay-related traffic parameters, such as arrival rate and burst size. We investigate the variation of the accuracy of the DNC analytical model and the measurement model under different parameters, and verify the accuracy of the proposed DNC analytical model by theoretical derivation and analysis and comparison with the measurement model under the NS3 platform. We discuss the impact of relevant parameters on the delay boundaries to determine which network configuration enables the end-to-end delay to meet the established requirements. This will provide valuable guidance for the design of Tactile Internet architectures. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The change of industrial automation towards a highly interconnected architecture is still ongoing. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an essential element for this transition. This paper focuses on TSN end stations, mainly answering how to implement a software-based worst-case execution time (WCET) analyzable buffer management. The two-level segregated fit (TLSF) algorithm was chosen, implemented, and evaluated based on an asymptotic complexity analysis of dynamic storage allocation algorithms. The implemented and improved TLSF algorithm showed similar timing behavior as calculated when executed on a time-predictable platform. The paper concludes by outlining further research. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Based on the communication requirements of IEC 61850 smart substation services and the basic principle of timesensitive networking (TSN), TSN technology is applied to ensure the real-time characteristic of substation communication services. The information flow service curve is established based on the switch forwarding principle of the TSN flow scheduling protocol IEEE 802.1Qbv. Based on the packet transmission characteristics of the substation communication network, the arrival curve of the information source is established, and a calculation method of the end-to-end maximum time delay of the substation packet transmission is proposed by using the network calculus theory. Through the simulation analysis of different levels of substation communication network, the results show that TSN technology meets the communication requirement of substation services, especially in ensuring the real-time transmission of time-sensitive services such as key control commands. The proposed maximum time delay calculation method provides a theoretical calculation basis for time delay analysis of applying TSN to smart substations.

AB  - Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is the future technology of industrial deterministic real-time communication. IEEE 802.1Qbv is one of the critical standards, which defines a gating mechanism, i.e. the time-aware shaper. This mechanism employs the time transmission gate and gate control list (GCL) to guarantee the real-time transmission for time-critical streams. However, most existing works focus on the single-level 802.1Qbv scheduling problems without consideration of route planning or queue assignment. In this paper, the deterministic transmission problem of multiple time-critical streams over the TSN-capable multi-hop and multi-queue network is investigated. To guarantee deterministic end-to-end delay for multiple time-critical streams, a co-design constraint set of scheduling and routing is constructed. Integrated with the constraints, a mapping method via Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) and an optimal co-design approach via Optimization Modulo Theories (OMT) are proposed. The objective of the proposed approach is to maximize network utilization by minimizing the usage of switch nodes for time-critical streams while guaranteeing the schedulability of network systems. Compared with the previous scheduling methods, the simulations show that the network utilization and the schedulability of network systems are significantly improved by the proposed approach.

AB  - Recent work on automotive communications based on the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards proposed an approach to handle all the real-time frames in a uniform way regardless of their arrival pattern. According to such an approach, instead of binding all the frames of the same flow to a traffic class, each periodic or event-driven frame is scheduled based on its absolute deadline according to the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) algorithm. The approach does not impose additional frame overhead and does not require complex offline configurations that would be unsuitable for event-driven traffic. However, EDF scheduling cannot support time-driven communications. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a framework that combines the flexibility of online EDF frame scheduling for both periodic and event-driven traffic with the ability to guarantee temporal isolation to time-driven traffic. The paper describes the design of the proposed approach and the performance obtained using the OMNeT++ simulation environment. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - To support reliable and low-latency communication, Time-Sensitive Networking introduced protocols and interfaces for resource allocation in Ethernet. However, the implementation of these allocation algorithms has not yet been covered by the standards. Our work focuses on deadline-guaranteeing resource allocation for networks with static and dynamic traffic. To achieve this, we combine offline network optimization heuristics with online admission control and, thus, allow for new flow registrations while the network is running. We demonstrate our solution on Credit-Based Shaper networks by using the delay analysis framework Network Calculus. We compare our approach with an intuitive and a brute-force algorithm, where we can achieve significant improvements, both, in terms of quality and runtime. Thereby, our results show that we can guarantee maximum end-to-end delays and also increase the flexibility of the network while requiring only minimal user input. © 2024, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

AB  - In this paper we are interested in real-time control applications that are implemented using Fog Computing Platforms consisting of interconnected heterogeneous Fog Nodes (FNs). Similar to previous research and ongoing standardization efforts, we assume that the communication between FNs is achieved via the IEEE 802.1 Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) standard. We model the control applications as a set of real-time flows, and we assume that the messages are transmitted using scheduled traffic that is using the Gate Control Lists (GCLs) in TSN. Given a network topology and a set of control applications, we are interested to synthesize the GCLs for messages such that the Quality-of-Control (QoC) of control applications is maximized and the deadlines of real-time messages are satisfied. We have proposed a Constraint Programming (CP)-based solution to this problem, and developed an accurate analytical model for QoC, which, together with a metaheuristic search employed in the CP solver can drive the search quickly towards good quality solutions. We have evaluated the proposed strategy on several test cases including realistic test cases and also validate the resulted GCLs on a TSN hardware platform and via simulations in OMNET++.

AB  - Industry 4.0 and Autonomous Driving are emerging resource-intensive distributed application domains that deal with open and evolving environments. These systems are subject to stringent resource, timing, and other non-functional constraints, as well as frequent reconfiguration. Thus, real-time behavior must not preclude operational flexibility. This combination is motivating ongoing efforts within the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) standardization committee to define admission control mechanisms for Ethernet. Existing mechanisms in TSN, like those of AVB, its predecessor, follow a distributed architecture that favors scalability. Conversely, the new mechanisms envisaged for TSN (IEEE 802.1Qcc) follow a (partially) centralized architecture, favoring short reconfiguration latency. This paper shows the first quantitative comparison between distributed and centralized admission control architectures concerning reconfiguration latency. Here, we compare AVB against a dynamic real-time reconfigurable Ethernet technology with centralized management, namely HaRTES. Our experiments show a significantly lower latency using the centralized architecture. We also observe the dependence of the distributed architecture in the end nodes' performance and the benefit of having a protected channel for the admission control transactions.

AB  - The embedded avionics system is a typical mission-critical and safety-critical system, and should ensure fulfillment of all constraints for all flows with individual timing requirements transmitted in networks. Scheduling strategies are used to meet this requirement, and different networking solutions have different approaches. AFDX (Avionics Full-DupleX Switched Ethernet) implements a SPQ (Strict Priority Queuing) scheduling strategy with two priority levels where large flow bursts from high priority data would lead to high delays for low priority flows. Ethernet-AVB (Audio Video Bridging) implements Credit-Based Shapers (CBS) on top of the SPQ mechanism, which can partly mitigate this problem. This kind of scheduling strategy could be considered in an avionics context for mix-criticality systems. In this paper, CBS and SPQ scheduling algorithms are compared especially from the worst-case criteria by using network calculus approach. Results show that compared with SPQ, CBS has a better anti-interference ability, though it would bring a bigger delay even from the worst-case prospective.

AB  - Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet) is a time-critical network for industrial and avionics applications improved from the Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX). It is standardized by SAE AS6802 and satisfies strict timing transmission by use of a mixture infrastructure to support Time-Triggered (TT), Rate-Constraint (RC) and Best-Effort (BE) traffics. The key feature is a time-triggered communication paradigm according to off-line schedule table based on global synchronization. Three integration methods (preemption, timely block and shuffling) are used to resolve conflict when a TT message gets ready and a RC message is already in transmission. Besides several real-time Ethernet solutions, Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) shows great interests and attractions to satisfy the increasing and variable transmission requirements for automotive and aeronautical industry. TSN is comprised of several IEEE standards developed under IEEE 802.1 TSN Task Group, such as 802.1AS, 802.1Qav, 802.1Qat, 802.1BA, 802.1Qbv and 802.1Qbu. On top of SPQ (Static Priority Queuing) scheduling mechanism, with best effort traffics in parallel, TSN introduces guaranteed timing behavior with focus on the transportation for Control Data traffic (CDT) under Time Aware Shaper (TAS) and audio video streams under Credit-Based Shaper (CBS). This paper introduces the basic principles of TSN standard in details, compares it with the properties of the TTEthernet standard. In particular, we first investigate their clock synchronization algorithms and discuss their shaping and scheduling strategies for traffic types with individual timing requirements. Then we show the impact the hard real-time traffic has on soft real-time traffic and give the worst case end-to-end latency calculation. Finally, we determine whether TSN offers flexibility for the requirements of avionic.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a task group of the IEEE 802.1 standardization working group (WG) developing the IEEE 802.1 TSN communication standards. TSN is developing a “toolbox” of many standards to provide support for enabling the separation of critical and non-critical traffic, the timeliness and dependability, i.e., reliability, fault-tolerance, and security, of critical traffic. In this paper we focus on the Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) traffic shapers, such as the original CQF, the Cycle Specified Queuing and Forwarding (CSQF) and an extension of those, the so-called Multi-CQF shaper. We define formally the problem of configuring CQF-based networks. We have developed a Constraint Programming (CP) formulation for Multi-CQF, as well as a Simulated Annealing (SA)-based metaheuristic solution. These solutions can also obtain results for CQF and CSQF, which can be seen as a special case of Multi-CQF. The CQF configuration problem is NP-hard. We evaluate our solutions on several test cases and scenarios. The CP formulation can find optimal solutions for small problem sizes but does not scale for realistic test cases. However, SA is able to handle large test cases and to find good quality solutions, making it suitable for both design-time and runtime network configuration. We also present comprehensive evaluation results comparing the CQF-based variants (CQF, CSQF, Multi-CQF) on industrial use cases, contrast them to the Time Aware Shaper (TAS, 802.1Qbv), and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

AB  - To reduce the latency of time-sensitive flows in Ethernet networks, the IEEE TSN Task Group introduced the IEEE 802.1Qbu Standard, which specifies a 1-level preemption scheme for IEEE 802.1 networks. Recently, serious limitations of this scheme w.r.t. flows responsiveness were exposed and the so-called multi-level preemption approach was proposed to address these drawbacks. As is the case with most, if not all, real-time and/or time-sensitive preemptive systems, an appropriate priority-to-flow assignment policy plays a central role in the resulting performance of both 1-level and multi-level preemption schemes to avoid the over-provisioning and/or the sub-optimal use of hardware resources. Yet on another front, the multi-level preemption scheme raises new configuration challenges. Specifically, the right number of preemption level(s) to enable for swift transmission of flows; and the flow-to-preemption-class assignment synthesis remain open problems. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work in the literature addressing these important challenges. In this work, we address these three challenges. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed solution by using both synthetic and real life use-cases. Our experimental results show that multi-level preemption schemes improve schedulability of flows by over 12% as compared to a 1-level preemption scheme, and at a higher abstraction level, the proposed configuration framework improves the schedulability of flows by up to 6% as compared to the dominant Deadline Monotonic Priority Ordering. © 2022 ACM.

AB  - Modern Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) combine critical real-time and non-critical best-effort tasks and messages onto an integrated multi-core multi-SoC hardware platform. The real-time safety-critical software tasks have complex interdependencies in the form of end-to-end latency chains featuring, e.g., sensing, processing/sensor fusion, and actuating. The underlying real-time operating systems running on top of the multi-core platform use static cyclic scheduling for the software tasks, while the communication backbone is either realized through PCIe or Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). In this paper, we address the problem of configuring ADAS platforms for automotive applications, which means deciding the mapping of tasks to processing cores and the scheduling of tasks and messages. Time-critical messages are transmitted in a scheduled manner via the timed-gate mechanism described in IEEE 802.1Qbv according to the pre-computed Gate Control List (GCL) schedule. We study the computation of the assignment of tasks to the available platform CPUs/cores, the static schedule tables for the real-time tasks, as well as the GCLs, such that task and message deadlines, as well as end-to-end task chain latencies, are satisfied. This is an intractable combinatorial optimization problem. As the ADAS platforms and applications become increasingly complex, such problems cannot be optimally solved and require problem-specific heuristics or metaheuristics to determine good quality feasible solutions in a reasonable time. We propose two metaheuristic solutions, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and one based on Simulated Annealing (SA), both creating static schedule tables for tasks by simulating Earliest Deadline First (EDF) dispatching with different task deadlines and offsets. Furthermore, we use a List Scheduling-based heuristic to create the GCLs in platforms featuring a TSN backbone. We evaluate the proposed solution with real-world and synthetic test cases scaled to fit the future requirements of ADAS systems. The results show that our heuristic strategy can find correct solutions that meet the complex timing and dependency constraints at a higher rate than the related work approaches, i.e., the jitter constraints are satisfied in over 6 times more cases, and the task chain constraints are satisfied in 41% more cases on average. Our method scales well with the growing trend of ADAS platforms. Copyright © 2022 McLean, Juul Hansen, Pop and Craciunas.

AB  - Recent developments in the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) group have put forth a number of mechanisms to improve deterministic latency in layer 2 switches. Their shaping approaches differ with respect to prerequisites, flexibility, maximum latency, and latency variation (jitter). Asynchronous solutions provide flexibility in dynamic scenarios, but Credit-Based Shaping (CBS) and Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) come with a high latency variance, as the minimum latency is not affected by them. Some applications in industrial and automotive use cases require low jitter while trying to avoid a dependency on time synchronization, and even TSN's redundancy mechanism benefits from a lower latency variance. This work is bridging the gap between low-jitter transmission requirements and asynchronous shaping mechanisms. In this paper, the application of a stateless Asynchronous Constant Delay Shaper (ACDS) is discussed. It collects the queuing duration from the previous bridge to delay each frame for the remaining time such that a constant per-hop delay for each frame is achieved. The discussion includes the prerequisites, the mechanism itself, and its technical complexity, as well as a formal analysis of its guaranteed latency by proving its relation to a token-bucket based ATS. Further, two extensions are discussed, and an evaluation shows the applicability of ACDS by comparing its jitter to ATS in a frame-level simulation.

AB  - The deterministic behavior of real-time communication networks is achieved by time-triggered periodic schedules for critical data traffic. Calculating such a schedule requires satisfying a lot of constraints, which in practice may be difficult due to the increasing number of data flows in the network. In the current approaches, the routes of flows are usually given or determined separately from the scheduling process. If the routes of flows can be computed jointly with scheduling, more flows could be scheduled since the algorithm chooses among alternative paths. This paper formalizes the problem of joint routing and scheduling of time-triggered periodic communication in Time-Sensitive Networks, guaranteeing the required deterministic nature of the communication, and proposes two models in Constraint Programming formalism. We further apply the Logic-Based Benders Decomposition on the proposed models and give an extensive experimental evaluation of our solutions showing that our novel approach that models waiting of frames in queues along with the Logic-Based Benders Decomposition exhibits the best performance and significantly increases the schedulability over the state-of-the-art methods. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Satellite formation flying with functional payloads can provide flexibility and real-time services for time sensitive missions through the cooperation of intra-satellite wired and inter-satellite wireless communication systems. However, the difference between wired and wireless scheduling mechanisms will increase the instability of forwarding delay at satellite. To solve this problem, we propose a wired and wireless converged scheduling scheme. Firstly, we construct the transmission rate and time division multiple access scheduling model to describe the inter-satellite link, and the IEEE 802.1Qbv scheduling model for wired link respectively. Secondly, we analyze the influence of the position of packet in different time slots on the forwarding delay, to model the relationship between the converged scheduling and forwarding delay. Finally, we formulate the converged scheduling as a zero-one programming problem with minimum jitter, and adopt the genetic-tabu search algorithm to solve it. Simulation results demonstrate that the delay is reduced by 20%, the jitter is not higher than $40\mu\mathrm{s}$.

AB  - As an emerging communication tool, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is proposed by the IEEE 802.1 TSN Task Group to achieve deterministic data transmission. TSN defines protocols to ensure the determinism of traditional Ethernet by configuring gate control list (GCL). However, calculating schedules of GCL according to different time-sensitive applications, is not well-defined in the standard. In this paper, we focus on the problem of mixed time-sensitive data transmission. To this end, we first model the data into three categories: high time-sensitive (HTS) flows, low time-sensitive (LTS) flows, and best-effort flows. Then based on the models, we propose a coordinated transmission framework to transmit mixed time-sensitive data. Under this framework, we develop a parameter selection approach for choosing the proper cycle time and the scheduling unit. To reduce the impact of HTS data on LTS data flows, we formulate a fine-grained scheduling problem. Then, we design an injection time grouping (ITG) algorithm by grouping the flows with the same period to reduce the computation complexity. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the parameter selection approach and ITG algorithm. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The existing worst-case response time (WCRT) analysis for individual priority classes under credit-based shaping (CBS) in Ethernet AVB based on so-called eligible intervals is both independent and tight. This WCRT analysis does not rely on any assumptions on interfering inter-priority streams other than those enforced by the Ethernet standard. A major advantage of this independent analysis is that CBS may be viewed as resource reservation, where allocated bandwidth is both guaranteed and enforced. Although independent analysis provides inter-priority class robustness, it comes at a cost of over-provisioning bandwidth. We illustrate this cost of inter-priority class robustness by means of an example that requires 7.8 times the amount of bandwidth reservation for a given set of streams compared to a different analysis that takes knowledge of inter-priority streams into account.

AB  - Deterministic and low latency communications are increasingly becoming essential requirements for several safety-critical applications, such as automotive and automation industries. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an element of the new IEEE 802.1 standards that introduced Ethernet-based amendments to support these applications. One of these enhancements was presented in IEEE 802.1Qbv to define the time-aware shaping (TAS) technique for time-triggered (TT) traffic scheduling. The TAS mechanism is window-based scheduling using a gating system controlled by the gate control list (GCL) schedules in all nodes. Although several scheduling algorithms have been proposed to investigate the effects of window-related parameters on network performance, the offset difference ( $OD$ ) between the same-class windows in the adjoining nodes has not been optimized yet. These optimizations are extremely crucial to implement less pessimistic latency schedules. This paper proposes an optimized flexible window-overlapping scheduling (OFWOS) algorithm that optimizes TT window offsets based on latency evaluations considering the overlapping between different priority windows at the same node. First, we formulate the GCL timings as mathematical forms under variable $OD\text{s}$ between the same-priority windows. Then, an analytical model is implemented using the network calculus (NC) approach to express the worst-case end-to-end delay ( $WCD$ ) for TT flows and evaluated using a realistic vehicular use case. The OFWOS model optimizes $OD$ under all overlapping situations between TT windows at the same node. Compared with the latest works of 3-hop and 30-hop TSN connections, the OFWOS reduces the $WCD$ bounds by 8.4% and 32.6%, respectively, accomplishing less pessimistic end-to-end latency bounds.

AB  - IEEE time sensitive networks (TSN) offer redundant paths for automation networks that are essential preconditions for network load balancing (NLB) or distribution. They also provide several traffic shapers and schedulers with different impacts on the data flow control. The selection of the right traffic shaper or scheduler for an automation network is challenging. Their influence depends on various network parameters such as network extension, network cycles, application cycles, and the amount of data per traffic class and network cycle. In this study, data flow control for NLB in automation TSN using different traffic shapers and schedulers was investigated. The effects of the network parameters on the shapers and schedulers were derived and imported into the data flow control model of the automation network. The sample networks were simulated, and performance comparisons were made. The results show that the enhancements for scheduled traffic (EST), strict priority queuing (SPQ), and the combination of SPQ with frame preemption (FP) are better scheduler selections in connection with larger networks, fast network cycles, and fast application cycles. The cyclic queuing and forwarding (CQF) shaper and asynchronous traffic shaper (ATS) are rather an alternative for load control in small networks or in conjunction with slow applications.

AB  - The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) set of standards allows to support on the same channel the different kinds of traffic flows that are typically found in automotive scenarios. This article proposes the introduction of online Earliest Deadline First-based scheduling in TSN to provide support for event-driven real-time traffic. The proposed approach, called Deadline-TSN, is an online approach, and therefore, unlike other approaches in the literature, it does not require complex offline schedule calculations. Moreover, Deadline-TSN is able to uniformly deal with real-time periodic and event-driven traffic flows. This article presents Deadline-TSN and provides both worst-case response time analysis and simulative assessments in realistic automotive scenarios.

AB  - The IEEE 802.1Q working group defines the Ethernet time-sensitive networking (TSN) standard to support data-intensive industrial real-time networks. Unfortunately, TSN has the possibility for frame priority inversion that can lead to deadline misses. In this paper, we present a novel approach to address priority inversion in TSN that prioritizes frames during network configuration, determines traffic paths off-line with integer linear programming (ILP), and schedules transmissions on-line using the earliest deadline first (EDF) algorithm. Our approach, the ILP deadline-based TSN (ILP-DTSN), optimizes the network for time-sensitive traffic while minimizing the blocking effects of preemption. ILP-DTSN results in fewer missed deadlines compared with the time-aware shaper (TAS) with one-level preemption while reducing average end-to-end latency by up to 32%.

AB  - Machine learning has been recently applied in real-time systems to predict whether Ethernet network configurations are feasible in terms of meeting deadline constraints without executing conventional schedulability analysis. However, the existing prediction techniques require domain expertise to choose the relevant input features and do not perform consistently when topologies or traffic patterns differ significantly from the ones in the training data. To overcome these problems, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) prediction model that synthesizes relevant features directly from the raw data. This deep learning model possesses the ability to exploit relations among flows, links, and queues in switched Ethernet networks and generalizes to unseen topologies and traffic patterns. We also explore the use of ensembles of GNNs and show that it enhances the robustness of the predictions. An evaluation on heterogeneous testing sets comprising realistic automotive networks shows that ensembles of 32 GNN models feature a prediction accuracy ranging from 79.3% to 90% for Ethernet networks using priorities as the Quality-of-Service mechanism. The use of ensemble models provides a speedup factor ranging from 77 to 1,715 compared to schedulability analysis, which allows a far more extensive design space exploration. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Time-Aware Shaper(TAS), as an vitally important synchronous scheduling mechanism in Time-Sensitive Networks(TSN), is defined by the IEEE 802.1 Qbv [1] standard. TAS achieves non-waiting transmission of Time-Triggered(TT) streams by using Gate Control List(GCL). This paper analyzes the end-to-end(E2E) latency of time-sensitive flows when using the TAS mechanism. We built a testing platform using TSN switches and a professional tester. In the presence of background flows, we changed some key parameters and conducted multiple sets of tests. The test results indicate that when the TAS mechanism takes effect, it can achieve bounded latency for high priority traffic. In addition, ensuring the match between the arrival of high priority traffic and the GCL is a prerequisite for the high-performance operation of TAS.

AB  - Many Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications have zero fault tolerance. Redundant networks are hence an important prerequisite for a dependable infrastructure to serve the various data traffic classes required for such applications. In this paper, we perform a delay analysis of a Quality Checks After Production (QCAP) application, which is running on a Time-Sensitive Network (TSN). We evaluate the worst-case delay of all data flows traversing the redundant TSN network using a Network Calculus (NC) based framework. We also evaluate how network parameters and configurations affect the QCAP application's service requirements.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) extends traditional Ethernet to support data traffic with ultra-reliability and time-critical requirements for a range of applications in industrial automation, automotive, and aerospace. The TSN standards present guidelines to integrate different types of data traffic over a single converged network. Therefore, it is becoming an enabling technology towards the Industry 4.0 vision of integrating information and operational technologies within future Industrial Internet of Things networks. In this paper, we develop a network calculus based framework to analyse TSN based industrial networks supporting a range of data traffic classes. We apply the framework to study and analyse a well-known industrial use case, Quality Checks After Production (QCAP), with four data traffic types with different requirements in terms of reliability and end-to-end latency. In our evaluation, we validate our framework with a computer simulation model and compare the tightness of the calculated delay bounds to a state-of-the-art approach. We then use our model to analyse the upper bounds on the worst-case delay of the different QCAP traffic types and assess the factors that impact end-to-end delay, e.g. flow offset and critical links. Finally, we compare various credit accumulation rates and their impact on the traffic delay bounds.

AB  - The IEEE 802.1Qcr Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) proposed by Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) is a flow control mechanism based on Urgency-based Scheduler (UBS). The ATS aims to reshape flows or traffic per-hop and is still with the update of the draft.In the draft of version 2.0, the ATS algorithm concerns about two parameters cir (Committed Information Rate) and cbs (Committed Burst Size). When an ATS shaper operates in the condition of parameter consistency, i.e. the cir and the cbs have the same values of the ingress flow's rate and burstiness respectively, the burst cascade can be avoided perfectly.On the contrary, we introduced a deterministic Network Calculus (NC) based method to compute the delay bound for an ATS hop with parameter inconsistency, with a concatenation model of this ATS shaper and its upstream Strict Priority Queuing (SPQ) scheduler. Furthermore, we induced a threshold for the cbs parameter corresponding to a certain ingress busrtiness. When the cbs of ATS is not equal to the threshold value, the delay bound of the flows shaped by the shaper will increase. In addition, the results of analysis and case study show that when the cbs of the ATS is changed, the delay bounds of other multiplexing flows will also be affected.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a cluster of protocols working in the data link layer of the OSI reference model, which has been introduced into the industrial Internet due to its ability to ensure the deterministic transmission of data. Through IEEE 802.1AS clock synchronization and IEEE 802.1 Qbv gating mechanism, TSN networks allocate separate transmission time slots for periodic signals to ensure low delay and jitter, but this increases the delay of aperiodic stream to some extent. In this paper, a scheduling scheme of Grouping transmission is proposed. By changing the sending time of periodic data stream, the periodic data stream which is originally continuously transmitted is divided into several groups to be transmitted in different time periods in a cycle, so as to reduce the real-time aperiodic data stream delay. Experimental results show that the proposed scheduling scheme can reduce the transmission delay of the non-periodic traffic without affecting the quality of service (QoS) of the periodic traffic. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Applications such as virtual/augmented reality, autonomous systems, and telemedicine require delay-bounded transmission. This paper combines the software-defined network (SDN) paradigm and proposes an integrated solution for topology construction and routing (TCR). First, the solution gives a delaybounded constraint for adding valid links, which can be adapted to various topology construction methods. Then, topology discovery, resource management, flow management, and route selection are performed in the orchestration and configuration plane. TCR enables time-sensitive network management and configuration with flexibility. The performance of the TCR is evaluated in a typical industrial network topology. The experimental results show that the TCR can effectively reduce the average path length (APL), guarantee bounded delay, and is beneficial for load balancing. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - With real-time communication being a key part of the fourth industrial revolution, the need for Quality of Service (QoS) in industrial networks is gaining increasing importance. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) faces this need, for example, by introducing new scheduling mechanisms. The Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) has been introduced to TSN to offer low delays for multiple traffic classes by applying rate limitations. Currently, flows are reserved decentrally in CBS networks using a Stream Reservation Protocol (SRP). In contrast, the new TSN standard IEEE 802.1Qcc allows for a centralized architecture to favor short reconfiguration latencies. However, no online admission control scheme which offers safe delay bounds has been proposed for this central architecture. To close this gap, we propose two models for admission control in TSN networks using CBS. Both models offer deadline-guaranteeing flow allocation, including routing and prioritization of flows, and configure forwarding devices while eliminating packet loss. Our models utilize the mathematical framework of Network Calculus to calculate worst-case flow delays and buffer sizes. We show how our models allow for more reservations than the decentralized standard approach by improved resource utilization. We validate our models both in synthetic and industrial network scenarios. Additionally, we compare the effects and parameters of our two models, providing guidance on when to choose them.

AB  - In time-sensitive networks, the frames of time-triggered (TT) flows need to be transmitted in scheduled slots. To avoid the interference of frames from other flows to the frames of the TT flows, guard bands are generally reserved prior to scheduled slots. The time-sensitive networking (TSN) standard, IEEE 802.1Qbu, specifies a frame preemption model that enables frames of TT flows (preemption frames) to preempt frames of other flows (preempted frames). According to this model, preempted frames are divided into fragments that are transmitted in the gaps of preemption frames. Consequently, the IEEE 802.1Qbu model reduces the guard band from the longest Ethernet frame (typically 1518 bytes) to 123 bytes, which improves the bandwidth utilization and delay performance of preempted frames without causing frame disorder. However, in scenarios in which the preempted frame load is heavy, and the length is short, numerous guard bands smaller than 123 bytes are generated. These guard bands prevent the IEEE 802.1Qbu model from transmitting preempted frame fragments, resulting in a considerable decrease in bandwidth utilization. To solve this problem, we propose a novel frame preemption model without guard bands, based on a padding and splicing mechanism. While ensuring that preemption frames are transmitted according to scheduled slots, this model can transmit preempted frames within arbitrary byte gaps based on the schedule without obtaining the length of the preempted frames in advance. We compared the transmission-delay performance of the proposed model with that of the IEEE 802.1Qbu model using a theoretical analysis. The evaluation results obtained from heavily loaded preemption frame scenarios revealed that the proposed model improved link utilization by 32.8% relative to the IEEE 802.1Qbu model and reduced the transmission delay by more than one order of magnitude. Moreover, when the IEEE 802.1Qbu model fails, the proposed model still transmits 60% of preempted frames. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Advances in automotive technology require networks to support a variety of communication requirements, such as reliability, real-time performance, low jitter, and strict delay limits. Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) is a keyframe transmission delay-guaranteed solution based on the IEEE 802 architecture of the automotive Ethernet. However, most of the existing studies on automotive TSN performance are based on a single mechanism, lacking a complete and systematic research tool. At the same time, the design method should be considered from a global perspective when designing an automotive TSN system, rather than only considering a single mechanism that TSN applies to. This paper discusses the correspondence between traffic types and automotive scenarios and proposes a methodology to target the delay constraint of traffic types as the design goal of automotive TSN networks. To study the performance of automotive TSN under different mechanisms such as time-aware shaper (TAS), credit-based shaper (CBS), cyclic queuing and forwarding (CQF), etc., this paper also develops a systematic automotive TSN simulation system based on OMNeT++. The simulation system plays a crucial role in the whole methodology, including all applicable TSN standards for the automotive field. Lastly, a complex automotive scenario based on zonal architecture provided by a major motor company in Shanghai is analyzed in the simulated system; verifying TSN can guarantee real-time performance and reliability of the in-vehicle network. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Ethernet-compatible interconnections can be widely used in avionics due to its flexibility and scalability. With the growing demand for high bandwidth, low latency, and reliability, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has been proposing a series of standards to improve the real-time performance of Ethernet, among which flow control strategies including Credit Based Shaping (CBS), Time-Aware Shaping (TAS), and Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) have been applied.Taking advantage of the globally synchronized clock, the TAS mechanism can achieve low latency for Time-Triggered (TT) traffic communication by establishing completely non-overlapping time windows, with the difficulties in higher system complexity. Using the token bucket shaping method, ATS can provide per-flow logical isolation for AVB traffic without the need for global clock synchronization. However, the improper parameter configuration of Committed Information Rate (CIR) and Committed Burst Rate (CBS) in ATS will lead to a dramatic rise in transmission latency.In this paper, to realize timing gate control under low complexity, a design of the flow control strategy, Gate Controlled Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (GCATS), which incorporates the Gate Control List (GCL) of TAS into the token bucket shaping method, is introduced. With the clock synchronization on the current node, GCATS reshapes traffic using an ATS-like per-flow token bucket method, reducing the computational cost and time constraints caused by the global clock synchronization of TAS. Simulation results show that, compared to TAS, GCATS configured with GCL tables of different granularity can provide fine-grained service for lower-priority traffic and reduce the transmission delay, that is, when given a default GCL, GCATS serves specific traffic without the need for network-wide clock synchronization.

AB  - Switched Ethernet has been, and will also be increasingly common in current and future real-time and embedded systems. The IEEE 802.1 working group has recently developed standards and technologies, commonly referred to as Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), to enhance switched Ethernet with timeliness and dependability. We address, for the first time, the synthesis problem for the TSN frame preemption standards IEEE 802.3br-2016 and 802.1Qbu-2016 by introducing two new configuration parameters: flow to queue and queue to Express/Preemptable MAC interface assignments. We present an optimization framework to determine these configuration parameters with reliability as the optimization goal. Our proposed framework is shown to outperform commonly used priority-assignment as well as intuitive approaches.

AB  - Distributed real-time systems (DRTSs) composed of many embedded end-systems have been widely adopted in the industrial fields. Time-sensitive networking (TSN), as a promising communication infrastructure for DRTS, has shown great potential in industry and academia. TSN assumes that an end-system can release critical tasks to process critical packets strictly according to the prescheduled time. Unfortunately, two factors currently damage this assumption: 1) the jitter caused by system architecture during task release, task execution, and packet transmission; and 2) a TSN schedule result may exceed the execution capability of the end-system and cause conflicts. This article proposed deterministic chip (DetChip), a system-on-chip capable of deterministically implementing the TSN schedule result. DetChip supports time-triggered task release, time-predictable task execution and precise network transmission. Based on DetChip, this article first formalizes the execution capability of the end-system as end-system constraints (ECs). Existing TSN scheduling algorithms integrating ECs can solve conflicts by co-scheduling end-systems and the TSN network. Compared with previous works, DetChip only introduces few clock cycles jitter for critical task execution according to the TSN schedule result. The proposed ECs obtain 2× - 8× more conflict-free solutions for advanced scheduling algorithms with a linear increase in time overhead. Compared with the general end-system, DetChip can reduce 6× - 20× processing jitter to achieve better clock synchronization. © 1982-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The need to dynamically assign capacity to various network slices in virtualized C-RAN enabled 5G and beyond packet-switched networks require the added fronthaul network to be able to deliver standard bitrates. We therefore design a novel fronthaul network scheduling architecture and scheme based off the Burst Limiting Shaper (BLS) mechanism to provide Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to service differential traffic which include ultra Reliable and Low Latency communication (URLLC) traffic and non-URLLC traffic In this work we compare our strategy to Weighted Round Robin (WRR) scheduling algorithm under bursty and low traffic conditions. Simulations are used to evaluate our schemes performance ad show how well it compares to WRR.

AB  - This work presents a novel use case with Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN) for implementing a deterministic system allowing the joint transmission of all substation communications over the same Ethernet-based infrastructure. This approach streamlines the transition to Smart Grid by simplifying the typically complex architecture of electrical substations, characterized by multiple field buses and bridging devices. Thus, Smart Grid represents a disruptive innovation advancing substations to an “all-digital” environment with a uniform interface to access, manage, and update their communications and variables. TSN can serve as its underlying foundation as it is based on open, interoperable standards and enhancements for Ethernet that can establish deterministic communications with bounded end-to-end latency. This is shown with a TSN Proof of Concept (PoC) in a real-life substation that can integrate its most usual signals: digitized analog triggers for critical events or interlocks, GOOSE signaling (IEC 61850), and Best-Effort “Internet-like” traffic. This TSN PoC is shown to be versatile enough to propagate digitized critical events around 160 μs earlier than legacy substation equipment while preserving the integrity of background traffic. Furthermore, its flexibility was characterized in-depth in controlled laboratory tests, thereby confirming TSN as a viable alternative for supporting Smart Grid so long as the appropriate configuration is supplied.

AB  - Motivated by new use cases such as industrial automation and in-vehicle communication, Time-Sensitive Networking is further improving the layer 2 standards for real-time communication in Ethernet networks. As periodic traffic is a common requirement in such scenarios, the Time Aware Shaper (TAS) is a highly popular mechanism that allows the realization of real-time guarantees in synchronized networks. Most applications in literature suggest to configure the TAS for full stream isolation such that the lowest delays can be achieved. However, this “zero-queuing” strategy requires a high amount of computational resources and time, as the configuration of the gate control lists of each port is a complex task, which is not suitable for scenarios with dynamically changing requirements. This paper presents a novel approach with shared time windows. In combination with stream reservation techniques that are commonly applied for asynchronous mechanisms, the network is able to accept new streams during operation without complex reconfiguration, while still benefiting from some degree of isolation compared to conventional asynchronous shapers. The evaluation shows that, given the right circumstances, the number of accepted real-time streams can be improved significantly.

AB  - The future autonomous vehicle is not only processing the copious amount of indispensable data generated by its onboard sensors but also utilizing the data from other vehicles, roadside unit (RSU) etc. Managing the mixed-criticality data requires intelligent time-sensitive scheduling and routing within the in-vehicle network (IVN) infrastructure. Use-cases related to self-adaptivity (including vehicular communication), partial networking and embedded virtualization require to change the configuration of the IVN at runtime. State-of-the-art IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards possess a grave challenge in handling runtime reconfigurations. Above mentioned use-cases foster the development of scalable and efficient dynamic scheduling and routing algorithms for TSN based IVN. In this paper, four meticulously designed heuristics are analyzed for dynamic scheduling and routing on-the-fly in TSN based IVN. One of the algorithms, Bottleneck heuristic outperforms others in term of schedulability and response time. It schedules around 16 − 22% more flows as compared to other developed heuristics depending on the network load.

AB  - Total Flow Analysis (TFA) is a method for the worstcase analysis of time-sensitive networks. It uses service curve characterizations of the network nodes and arrival curves of flows at their sources; for tractability, the latter are often taken to be linear functions. For periodic flows, which are common in timesensitive networks, linear arrival curves are known to provide less good bounds than ultimately pseudo-periodic (UPP) arrival curves, which exactly capture the periodic behaviours. However, in existing tools, applying TFA with many flows and UPP curves quickly becomes intractable because when aggregating several UPP curves, the pseudo-period of the aggregate might become extremely large. We propose a solution to this problem, called Finite-Horizon TFA. The method computes finite horizons over which arrival and service curves can be restricted without affecting the end-results of TFA. It can be applied to networks with cyclic dependencies. We numerically show that, while remaining computationally feasible, the method significantly improves the bounds obtained by TFA when using linear curves.

AB  - The communication system of the next-generation train control system (TCS) based on cloud computing is modeled in this paper. The end-to-end communication delay is analyzed as the main factor affecting the real-time performance of the system. To improve this performance, a time-sensitive network (TSN) is introduced into the system. We analyze and simulate the end-to-end communication delay of systems with the TSN and compare it with traditional Ethernet. It is concluded that applying a TSN, based on the nw-DRR scheduling algorithm and with optimized parameters, can significantly reduce the end-to-end communication delay decreases from tens of milliseconds to milliseconds. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

AB  - As a new computing mode, edge computing moves computing, storage and network resources to edge nodes close to users, providing lower latency and better user experience for various applications. At the same time, the rapidly growing number of Internet users and traffic scale have also posed many challenges to edge nodes in the network. Among them, the traffic shaping and scheduling mechanism of edge nodes has become a key research issue. In this paper, an edge node network model using Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) mechanism is considered, and the end-to-end delay bound of the interested flow in this scenario is derived using Network Calculus theory. Based on the theoretical analysis method proposed in this paper, the upper bound of the number of users that can be connected to the network and the lower bound of the service resources provided by edge nodes are obtained. The findings of this study provide practical implications for the planning and resource allocation of edge nodes in scenarios like industrial Internet.

AB  - With the expansion of Internet application fields, traditional Ethernet cannot meet the real-time and deterministic requirements of time- and delay-sensitive applications. In order to solve this problem, the IEEE time-sensitive network group proposes a variety of Traffic shaping mechanisms. Among them, Asynchronous Traffic Shaper (ATS) scheduling can provide high link utilization and deterministic delay guarantee in the case of multiple traffic mixing in the network. And there is no need for strict clock synchronization between network devices. In order to solve the calculation problem of the ATS scheduling mechanism, this paper completes the theoretical delay upper bound calculation tool for flows with an ATS mechanism based on the delay analysis model in the Urgency-Based Scheduler (UBS).

AB  - Extraction of end-to-end timing information from software architectures of vehicular systems to support their timing analysis is a daunting challenge. To address this challenge, this paper presents a systematic method to extract this information from vehicular software architectures that can be distributed over several electronic control units connected by Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) networks. As a proof of concept, the proposed extraction method is applied to an industrial component model, namely the Rubus Component Model (RCM), and its toolchain. Furthermore, the usability of the proposed method is demonstrated in an industrial use case from the vehicular domain.

AB  - Time Sensitive Network (TSN) is a set of protocols working at the data link layer, which provides a delay guarantee for different services through various traffic shaping protocols. In TSN, to avoid timeouts caused by urgent services being blocked by large-bandwidth services, the IEEE 802.1 Qbu frame preemption protocol was proposed, which allows high-priority frames to reduce the delay by preempting low-priority frames. However, this mechanism will increase the delay of low-priority frames. With a unique storage structure, image and video can tolerate a certain degree of byte loss, such as color bytes, which will reduce the quality of the image but will not affect video fluency. Combined with this feature, in this paper, we propose a frame preemption enhancement mechanism assisted by frame truncation, which properly discards non-important bytes of the Ethernet frame payload field to ensure the deadline constraints. To minimize the information loss of service caused by frame truncation, we propose a frame structure based on the current Ethernet frame, which adjusts the bytes arrangement order according to their importance. In this case, when frame truncation is applied for satisfying the delay requirement, it can ensure that the discarded bytes are of the lowest importance. Simulation results show that, compared with the standard frame preemption mechanism, our proposed mechanism can send more payload bytes to the receiver without increasing the delay and jitter of other services, and the switch memory usage peak is also reduced by 12.41%.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and edge computing are promising networking technologies for the future of the Industrial Internet. TSN provides a reliable and deterministic low-latency communication service for edge computing. The Frame Replication and Elimination for Reliability (FRER) mechanism is important for improving the network reliability of TSN. It achieves high reliability by transmitting identical frames in parallel on two disjoint paths, while eliminating duplicated frames at the destination node. However, there are two problems with the FRER mechanism. One problem is that it does not consider the path reliability, and the other one is that it is difficult to find two completely disjoint path pairs in some cases. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a method to find edge-disjoint path pairs considering path reliability for FRER in TSN. The method includes two parts: one is building a reliability model for paths, and the other one is computing a working path and a redundant path with the Edge-Disjoint Path Pairs Selection (EDPPS) algorithm. Theoretical and simulation results show that the proposed method effectively improves path reliability while reducing the delay jitter of frames. Compared with the traditional FRER mechanism, the proposed method reduces delay jitter by 15.6% when the network load is 0.9. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a new set of amendments that guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of time-critical and safety-critical Ethernet applications. The guard band mechanism prevents time-sensitive traffic from colliding with non-time-sensitive traffic, causing potential bandwidth waste. Moreover, most of the existing scheduling strategies only consider Audio Video Bridging (AVB) traffic and Time-Triggered (TT) traffic, resulting in Best Effort (BE) traffic not being scheduled de facto. This article proposes a new system design and scheduling strategy for TSN switches. The size-aware group weighted round robin (SGWRR) strategy is proposed to schedule AVB queues according to subperiods, reducing the average scheduling intervals of the AVB frames. The entire scheduling cycle is divided into a protected slot and an unprotected slot, and dynamic programming is used to minimize guard band waste. An old queue priority (OQP) strategy is also proposed to provide scheduling opportunities for BE queues. A simulation of OMNet++ shows that SGWRR can achieve low average scheduling intervals while improving bandwidth utilization by 5.66% and that OQP can enhance BE scheduling opportunities by 21.9% under our experimental conditions compared with existing methods.

AB  - Possible evolution of Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) are currently investigated. Such network should support existing time-constrained avionics flows, as well as new best effort traffic, requiring scheduling algorithms to meet guarantees on avionics flows. Following the current trend of the automotive industry to move toward Audio/Video Bridging (AVB), this paper evaluates an application of the scheduling scheme described in the emerging IEEE 802.1 AVB standard in an avionics switched Ethernet scenario. Results are compared to other common scheduling strategies such as strict priority queuing, and different fair scheduling variants.

AB  - Predictable and low-latency communication timing is one of the major challenges for employing Ethernet-based networks in industrial automation. The evolving Ethernet AVB standard appears to be a promising architecture, as it provides mechanisms for predictable timing with standard Ethernet hardware. However, the worst-case timing of Ethernet AVB still has to be evaluated. In this paper, we analyze the timing of Ethernet AVB using both simulation and a formal worst-case analysis based on Compositional Performance Analysis known from embedded computing systems. We investigate two industrial scenarios, a typical line topology and a more complex two-level network, and compare the results from analysis and simulation. This allows us get a good indication of the applicability of the current Ethernet AVB with respect to predictable low-latency timing in industrial automation networks. We also gain an understanding of the benefits and limitations of formal Compositional Performance Analysis compared to simulation in this context.

AB  - In-car networks based on Ethernet are expected to be the first choice for future applications in the domain of info-and entertainment. However, the full benefit of a technologically integrated in-car network will only become rewarding with an Ethernet-based backbone, unifying several automotive domains in a single infrastructure. Today, there is remarkable interest in the IEEE 802.1 Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) protocol suite, that provides end-to-end performance guarantees in Ethernet networks. But for the strict timing requirements of automotive control-traffic, these guarantees are too weak. An extension of Ethernet AVB with synchronous time-triggered traffic can overcome these limitations. In this paper, we investigate the coexistence of synchronous and asynchronous traffic by experimentally adding time-triggered messages to the credit-based shaper of AVB in a straightforward way. Based on simulations and analytical evaluations, we quantify the impact of such integration concepts for a reasonable design range. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a shaping strategy with concurrent AVB and time-triggered message, but show a significant impact of the schedule design on the asynchronous AVB streams. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for configurations that can improve end-to-end network performance for in-car applications by over 100%.

AB  - In the field of intelligent connected vehicles, as the rate of in-vehicle communication continues to increase, the importance of real-time and reliability requirements has been more prominent. The time-sensitive networking (TSN) task group is dedicated to the amendments for meeting the urgent needs in the industrial field. In the implementation of the TSN, time latency bounds of critical traffic, memory bounds of nodes and utilization of transmission resources are needed to evaluate the feasibility of the TSNs. In this paper, we propose a framework called component-based analysis (CBA) to analyze these properties. In CBA, we use a data model, a resource model, and a component model to construct an abstract model of the TSNs with the system architecture and analyze the feasibility of this abstract model with real-time calculus. Moreover, we discuss the preemption mechanism mentioned in IEEE 802.1Qbu to handle the conflict of different priority queues, which has a serious influence on the resource model of the TSNs. Finally, we validate this framework by performing an analysis on a synthetic case and compare the obtained properties with different conflict handling mechanisms. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) technology is key to the development of current networks due to its capacity to provide a deterministic Quality of Service (QoS) mainly in terms of delay for different industrial traffic. It also simplifies management and improves the scalability of industrial networks. This articles focuses on Asynchronous Traffic Shape (ATS) for TSN. The key aspect of ATS is that by prioritizing flows delay requirement can be satisfied for each priority level. To that end, we formally formulate the problem of flow priority assignment in an network and we demonstrate the optimality of our proposed algorithm. We have compared our algorithm with the brute force search obtaining that the execution time of brute force is much higher than ours with exactly the same prioritization results.

AB  - Software defined networking (SDN) aims to standardize the control and configuration of network infrastructure. It consolidates network control by moving the network's control plane to a (logically) centralized controller and downgrading switches to simple forwarding devices. This offers huge advantages for future automotive Ethernet networks, including admission control (e.g. to prevent/limit congestion) or network reconfiguration (e.g. in case of faults), both based on a centralized view of the current network state. SDN's centralized architecture, however, requires additional communication, which entails a certain overhead. If SDN is used in safety-critical real-time networks, this communication is subject to strict timing requirements. In this paper, we present a formal analysis based evaluation of the general suitability of SDN for time-sensitive networks including overhead, scalability, and timing guarantees by using a realistic automotive setup.

AB  - Time sensitive networking (TSN) is an emerging technology for in-vehicle networks, which has strict timing constraints and dependability requirements. The performance and efficiency of TSN depend on a reliable scheduling mechanism for real-time communications. Traditionally, the TSN scheduler is analyzed using simulations and testing, which are error-prone and inaccurate. In this article, we employ a timed model checker UPPAAL to formally model and analyze the TSN scheduler with a consideration of its transmission latency and time utilization. We first use the build-in assertion in UPPAAL to verify the deadlock-free property, safety property, and starvation-free property of our model. Then, we calculate the time utilization and the transmission delay of audio video bridging data frame under two scheduling mechanisms according to the simulation process. Then, we compared the time performance of this two scheduling mechanisms and found that each of them has their own advantages and disadvantages. This article provides a formal analysis framework for investigating scheduling strategies in TSN, which facilitates the designers to have a better understanding and development of TSN schedulers in the future.

AB  - There are quite tight timing requirements in deterministic low latency network. The IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group has proposed several traffic shapers to satisfy real-time communications requirements. Traditionally, the performance of TSN is analyzed by simulations, whereas these methods cannot cover all corner cases. This paper firstly presented formal models of the TSN’s time-aware and peristaltic shapers using UPPAAL, tactically solving the problem mentioned above. Afterward, we verified some properties of the shapers models, of which the results could evaluate whether these shapers are able to satisfy strict timing requirements or not. Based on the models, we can discuss about the performance of time-critical traffic combining the preemption mechanism. More-over, we can also analyze resource utilization and transmission latency. Under the time properties analysis and verification of TSN traffic shapers, we can provide engineers with an accessible reference that may assist them in developing the TSN.

AB  - The asynchronous time-sensitive networking (TSN) based on IEEE 802.1Qcr is expected to be a promising solution for the asynchronous transmissions of safety-critical flows without the support of clock synchronization. When the asynchronous traffic shaping (ATS) mechanism is adopted to meet the deadline requirements for transmissions of safety-critical flow, it is necessary to formally verify the real-time properties and corresponding network performance. However, it is still unclear how to build an efficient formal model to evaluate different frame selection methods during the ATS scheduling process, which originate from the dominations of priority or eligibility time. In this paper, we present a formal modeling framework to compare the impacts of different frame selection on transmission sequence under the ATS mechanism. According to the priority level (pATS) or eligibility time (eATS) for flows, two transmission selection methods in ATS are modeled and compared. Then, we verify the real-time properties of ATS. The result shows that the shaping-for-free property can be satisfied with the pATS method but can not be fulfilled with the eATS method. Besides, the timing analysis results illustrate that the eATS method can provide more fairness than the pATS method for the transmission of low-priority flows in TSN networks.

AB  - Safety-critical traffic in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires real-time communications with high fault tolerance, bounded latency and low jitter. Time-Sensitive Software-Defined Network (TSSDN), which combines the deterministic transmission of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) with the centralized management of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), was recently proposed to support the real-time requirement in IIoT. The research on TSSDN has been receiving increasing interests, however, the existing work has limitations including 1) the functional safety of TSSDN cannot be guaranteed; and 2) the effect of the separation of data plane and control plane on the time-sensitivity of TSSDN has not been evaluated. Therefore, in this paper, we employ the timed model checker UPPAAL to formalize the TSSDN architecture. Firstly, we use the build-in checker in UPPAAL to verify deadlock-free property, functional safety property and starvation-free property of our model. Then, the total latency of frames forwarding and scheduling within a single switch is measured based on the model. We focus on the latency overhead of frames requesting processing rules from the controller, which is on average an additioanl 180µs latency in the worst case, but the impact of this delay on the time-sensitivity of TSSDN is tolerable. As far as we know, this is the first paper providing a formal verification and analysis approach for TSSDN architecture, which could benefit for both TSSDN designers as well as the researchers. © 2022 Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.

AB  - Ethernet is increasingly recognized as the future communication standard for distributed embedded systems in multiple domains such as industrial automation, automotive and avionics. A main motivation for this is cost and available data rate. A critical issue in the adoption of Ethernet in these domains is the timing of frame transfers, as many relevant applications require a guaranteed low-latency communication in order to meet real-time constraints. Ethernet AVB is an upcoming standard which addresses the timing issues by extending the existing strict-priority arbitration. Still, it needs to be evaluated whether these mechanism suffice for the targeted applications. For safety-critical applications, this can not only be done using intuition or simulation but requires a formal approach to assure the coverage of all worst-case corner cases. Hence, we present in this paper a formal worst-case analysis of the timing properties of Ethernet AVB and strict-priority Ethernet. This analysis mathematically determines safe upper bounds on the latency of frame transfers. Using this approach, we evaluate different topologies for a typical use-case in industrial automation.

AB  - Ethernet is considered as a future communication standard for distributed embedded systems in the automotive and industrial domains. A key challenge is the deterministic low-latency transport of Ethernet frames, as many safety-critical real-time applications in these domains have tight timing requirements. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an upcoming set of Ethernet standards, which (among other things) address these requirements by specifying new quality of service mechanisms in the form of different traffic shapers. In this paper, we consider TSN's time-aware and peristaltic shapers and evaluate whether these shapers are able to fulfill these strict timing requirements. We present a formal timing analysis, which is a key requirement for the adoption of Ethernet in safety-critical real-time systems, to derive worst-case latency bounds for each shaper. We use a realistic automotive Ethernet setup to compare these shapers to each other and against Ethernet following IEEE 802.1Q.

AB  - In deterministic time-aware networks, such as TTEthernet (TTE) and Time Sensitive Networking (TSN), time-triggered (TT) communication are often routed and scheduled without taking into account other critical traffic such as Rate-Constrained (RC) traffic. Consequently, the impact of a static transmission schedule for TT traffic can prevent RC traffic from fulfilling their timing constraints. In this paper, we present a general framework for routing, scheduling and formal timing analysis (FTA) in deterministic time-aware networks (e.g. TSN, TTE). The general framework drives an iterative execution of different modules (i.e. routing, scheduling and FTA) searching for a solution that fulfills an arbitrary number of defined constraints (e.g. maximum end-to-end RC and TT latency) and optimization goals (e.g. minimize reception jitter). The result is an iteratively improved solution including the routing configuration for TT and RC flows, the static TT schedule, a formal analysis for the RC traffic, as well as any additional outputs satisfying user constraints (e.g. maximum RC jitter). We then do a performance evaluation of the general framework, with a proposed implementation of the necessary modules for TTEthernet networks with mixed time-triggered and rate-constrained traffic. The evaluation of our studied realistic use case shows that, using the general framework, the end-to-end latency for RC traffic can be reduced up to 28.3%, and the number of flows not fulfilling their deadlines divided by up to 3 compared to existing methods. © Anaïs Finzi and Ramon Serna Oliver

AB  - Over recent years, traditional manufacturing factories have been accelerating their transformation and upgrade toward smart factories, which are an important concept within Industry 4.0. As a key communication technology in the industrial internet architecture, time-sensitive networks (TSNs) can break through communication barriers between subsystems within smart factories and form a common network for various network flows. Traditional routing algorithms are not applicable for this novel type of network, as they cause unnecessary congestion and latency. Therefore, this study examined the classification of TSN flows in smart factories, converted the routing problem into two graphical problems, and proposed two heuristic optimization algorithms, namely GATTRP and AACO, to find the optimal solution. The experiments showed that the algorithms proposed in this paper could provide a more reasonable routing arrangement for various TSN flows with different time sensitivities. The algorithms could effectively reduce the overall delay by up to 74% and 41%, respectively, with promising operating performances. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Time-sensitive network (TSN) is regarded as the perspective communication network for the intelligent vehicle application because of its reserved bandwidths, QoS mechanisms, low transmission latency. The message scheduling in the TSN have an important influence on the reliability and safety of vehicles. In this paper, the TSN messages between the vehicular electronic control units are classified into the control data traffic (CDT), the stream reservation (SR) and the best effort (BE). A hierarchical scheduling infrastructure for the three types of messages are presented, which consists of three scheduling strategies, i.e., FIFO, CBS and TAS. For the hierarchical scheduling mechanism, the influences of both FIFO and TAS on CBS are analyzed and an approach for the derivation of worst-case response times of SR message is proposed. The experiments in Vector CANoe show that the proposed method in this paper can effectively obtain the upper bound of SR message transmission in TSN. It can be used to improve the design of TSN system.

AB  - This paper presents the first holistic modeling approach for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) communication that integrates into a model-and component-based software development framework for distributed embedded systems. Based on these new models, we also present an end-to-end timing model for TSN-interconnected distributed embedded systems. Our approach is expressive enough to model the timing information of TSN and the timing behaviour of software that communicates over TSN, hence allowing end-to-end timing analysis. A proof of concept for the proposed approach is provided by implementing it for a component model and tool suite used in the vehicle industry. Moreover, a use case from the vehicle industry is modeled and analyzed with the proposed approach to demonstrate its usability.

AB  - Machine learning (ML), and supervised learning in particular, can be used to learn what makes it hard for a network to be feasible and try to predict whether a network configuration will be feasible without executing a conventional schedulability analysis. A disadvantage of ML-based timing verification with respect to schedulability analysis is the possibility of “false positives”: configurations deemed feasible while they are not. In this work, in order to minimize the rate of false positives, we propose the use of a measure of the uncertainty of the prediction to drop it when the uncertainty is too high, and rely instead on schedulability analysis. In this hybrid verification strategy, the clear-cut decisions are taken by ML, while the more difficult ones are taken by a conventional schedulability analysis. Importantly, the trade-off achieved between prediction accuracy and computing time can be controlled. We apply this hybrid verification method to Ethernet TSN networks and obtain, for instance in the case of priority scheduling with 8 traffic classes, a 99% prediction accuracy with a speedup factor of 5.7 with respect to conventional schedulability analysis and a reduction of 46% of the false positives compared to ML alone.

AB  - IEC 61850 has become the reference standard for Substation Automation Systems (SAS) in smart power grids. Current IEC 61850 compliant SAS use Ethernet technology for both Event-Triggered (ET) and Time-Triggered (TT) traffic to transport highly critical messages requiring low-latency guarantees. However the real-time guarantee is often achieved by over-provisioning network resources. In this paper we study the potentials of using Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) in SAS. TSN adds real-time enhancement to the existing IEEE 802.1Q standard by providing several new traffic shapers. If TT traffic can be guaranteed by scheduling its transmission at the right time using TSN time-aware shaper, it is not the case for ET traffic. The paper contribution is twofold: proposing a first mapping of the IEC 61850 protocols to the TSN traffic classes, based on the analysis of both TSN and IEC 61850 protocols; and developing an exact worst-case delay (WCD) analysis for ET traffic. The tightness of the developed WCD analysis has be shown by simulations.

AB  - Ethernet-AVB/TSN (Audio Video Bridging/Time-Sensitive Networking) and AFDX (Avionics Full DupleX switched Ethernet) are switched Ethernet technologies, which are both candidates for real-time communication in the context of transportation systems. AFDX implements a fixed priority scheduling strategy with two priority levels. Ethernet-AVB/TSN supports a similar fixed priority scheduling with an additional Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) mechanism. Besides, TSN can support time-triggered scheduling strategy. One direct effect of CBS mechanism is to increase the delay of its flows while decreasing the delay of other priority ones. The former effect can be seen as the shaping restriction and the latter effect can be seen as the shaping benefit from CBS. The goal of this paper is to investigate the impact of CBS on different priority flows, especially on the intermediate priority ones, as well as the effect of CBS bandwidth allocation. It is based on a performance comparison of AVB/TSN and AFDX by simulation in an automotive case study. Furthermore, the shaping benefit is modeled based on integral operation from network calculus perspective. Combing with the analysis of shaping restriction and shaping benefit, some configuration suggestions on the setting of CBS bandwidth are given. Results show that the effect of CBS depends on flow loads and CBS configurations. A larger load of high priority flows in AVB tends to a better performance for the intermediate priority flows when compared with AFDX. Shaping benefit can be explained and calculated according to the changing from the permitted maximum burst. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - When a Time-Sensitive Network, comes to networking, TSN is an assemblage of standards that may incorporate the Ethernet extension to enable real-time applications while maintaining the safety-critical distribution with the hardware and software. Multiple shaping processes, such as Credit-Based Shaping (CBS), Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS), Burst Limiting Shaping (BLS), and scheduling procedures, such as Time Aware Shaping (TAS), are used to enhance real-time guarantees. Different traffic types are also included in the shaping mechanism. It is very common to see the combination of CBS and TAS in industrial applications. CBS and TAS combination shaping adopt gate control list (GCL), which have periodic scheduling gate. However, due to the increased number of traffic, the frequency overlaps with different traffic gates, and for this reason, congestion of data in different traffic gates happens quite often. This paper proposes a theoretical approach that does not include overlapping gates; therefore, the service in the data traffic can be improved significantly. Integer Linear Programming has been used for producing proper scheduling procedures. Our proposed model contains a network calculus-based approach that can calculate the formal service curve of Time-Triggered (TT) and Audio Video Bridge (AVB) for Non-overlapping Gate. For further verification, MATLAB RTC has been utilized for several case studies. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Graph neural network (GNN) is an advanced machine learning model, which has been recently applied to encode Ethernet configurations as graphs and predict their feasibility in terms of meeting deadlines constraints. Ensembles of GNN models have proven to be robust to changes in the topology and traffic patterns with respect to the training set. However, the moderate prediction accuracy of the model, 79.3% at the lowest, hinders the application of GNN to real-world problems. This study proposes improvements to the base GNN model in the construction of the training set and the structure of the model itself. We first introduce new training sets that are more diverse in terms of topologies and traffic patterns and focus on configurations that are difficult to predict. We then enhance the GNN model with more powerful activation functions, multiple channels and implement a technique called global pooling. The prediction accuracy of ensemble of GNNs with a combination of the suggested improvements increases significantly, up to 11.9% on the same 13 testing sets. Importantly, these improvements increase only marginally the time it takes to predict unseen configurations, i.e., the speedup factor is still from 50 to 1125 compared to schedulability analysis, which allows a far more extensive exploration of the design space. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an upcoming set of Ethernet standards designed for real-time and safety-critical Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications in automotive, aerospace, and industrial automation domains. With the combination, complexity, and flexibility of flow control mechanisms in TSN connected systems, the performance analysis for mixed-critical messages is becoming a difficult challenge. The flexible window-based gate control list (GCL) scheduling model has been proposed as a relaxation to assumptions on frames-to-window allocation, mutually exclusive gates opening, and scheduled end systems and switches, which offers more flexibility in the configuration of GCLs. In this article, we are interested in providing a reliable verification method based on the network calculus theory to drive GCL configurations for TSN networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first performance analysis method suitable for the general flexible window-based GCLs in entire TSN networks, by reflecting the relative positional relationships of windows for same priority queues on consecutive nodes and constructing the window limitations into the shaper curve, in order to reduce the pessimism of the latency bounds. We validate the proposed method through Industrial IoT synthetics test cases and two large realistic cases, showing the significant reduction in pessimism on delay bounds, and the correctness and scalability by comparing with results from the previous work and simulation results.

AB  - With the increase in the number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and future requirements for vehicle functions, two SR (Stream Reservation) traffic classes may not be sufficient to ensure fulfilment of constraints for multiple traffic types with individual timing requirements transmitted in the Ethernet-AVB (Audio Video Bridging) networks. The goal of this paper is to determine the worst-case delay for an additional SR traffic class under the CBS (Credit-Based Shaper) algorithm. Delay evaluation is based on the impact analysis of CBS on different priority flows, particularly depending on when the credits of both SR class A and B drain from the worst-case perspective. More specifically, both the impact of CBS and the evolution trends of credit on different priority class flows are first analyzed from the worst-case perspective. Then, for an additional SR class, two types of worst-case delay models are established with the CBS configuration suggestions. Finally, an approach to calculate the worst-case queuing delay is proposed. Moreover, the worst-case end-to-end delay is determined by the network calculus approach and simulation. Numerical results show that the delay bounds of our models are tighter than those of other models, which is beneficial to the development of Ethernet-AVB for in-vehicle networking. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In this paper, we model and analyse the timing performance of an extended AFDX standard, incorporating the Burst Limiting Shaper (BLS) proposed by the Time Sensitive Networking group. The extended AFDX will enable the interconnection of different avionics domains with mixed-criticality levels, e.g., current AFDX traffic, Flight Control and In-Flight Entertainment. First, we present the model and the worst-case timing analysis, using the Network Calculus framework, of such an extended AFDX to infer real-time guarantees. Secondly, we conduct its performance evaluation on a representative AFDX configuration. Results show the tightness of the proposed model, with reference to simulation results. Moreover, they confirm the efficiency of incorporating the BLS in the AFDX standard to noticeably enhance the medium priority level delay bounds, while respecting the higher priority level constraints, in comparison with the current AFDX standard.

AB  - Existing papers on worst-case response time analysis for individual classes in Ethernet AVB typically focus on classes under credit-based shaping (CBS). There also exist industrial applications that use the Best-Effort class BE for non-hard real-time traffic with a minimum quality-of-service (QoS) require-ment, however. In this paper, we therefore present a conjecture for worst-case response time analysis for that class BE, stating that the existing analysis based on eligible intervals can be equally well applied to a single (highest-priority) stream without CBS, by simply assuming the remaining bandwidth to be available to that stream. The conjecture is illustrated using a figure.

AB  - Ethernet TSN is an upcoming communication standard for industrial distributed embedded systems with high demands on bandwidth and traffic delay. In this paper, we present and prove an improved analysis to determine bandwidth reservations for credit based shapers in a single Ethernet TSN switch. We compare this new analysis, which is based on eligible intervals, to the state-of-the-art bandwidth reservation analysis based on busy periods through experiments. Despite its low complexity and the independence of the knowledge of the interfering traffic, the results show an improvement of efficiency, i.e., a decrease of the required bandwidth, for the new analysis.

AB  - Offline scheduling of Scheduled Traffic (ST) in Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN) without taking into account the quality of service of non-ST traffic, e.g., time-sensitive traffic such as Audio-Video Bridging (AVB) traffic, can potentially cause deadline misses for non-ST traffic. In this paper, we report our ongoing work to propose a solution that, regardless of the ST scheduling algorithm being used, can ensure meeting timing requirements for non-ST traffic. To do this, we define a frame called Guard Frame (GF) that will be scheduled together with all ST frames. We show that a proper design for the GFs will leave necessary porosity in the ST schedules to ensure that all non-ST traffic will meet their timing requirements.

AB  - Recent trends such as automated driving in the automotive field and digitization in factory automation confront designers of real-time systems with new challenges. These challenges have arisen due to the increasing amount of data and an intensified interconnection of functions. For distributed safety-critical systems, this progression has the impact that the complexity of scheduling tasks with precedence constraints organized in so-called cause-effect chains increases the more data has to be exchanged between tasks and the more functions are involved. Especially when data has to be transmitted over an Ethernet-based communication network, the coordination between the tasks running on different end-devices and the network flows has to be ensured to meet strict end-to-end deadlines. In this work, we present an incremental heuristic approach that computes schedules for distributed and data-dependent cause-effect chains consisting of multi-rate tasks and network flows in time-sensitive networks. On the one hand, we provide a common task model for tasks and network flows. On the other hand, we introduce the concept of earliest and latest start times to speed up the solution discovery process and to discard infeasible solutions at an early stage. Our algorithm is able to solve large problems for synthetic network topologies with randomized data dependencies in a few seconds on average under strict end-to-end deadlines. We have achieved a high success rate for multi-rate cause-effect chains and an even better result for homogeneous or harmonic chains. Our approach also showed low jitter for homogeonous cause-effect chains.

AB  - Time-sensitive networks (TSNs) support not only traditional best-effort communications but also deterministic communications, which send each packet at a deterministic time so that the data transmissions of networked control systems can be precisely scheduled to guarantee hard real-time constraints. No-wait scheduling is suitable for such TSNs and generates the schedules of deterministic communications with the minimal network resources so that all of the remaining resources can be used to improve the throughput of best-effort communications. However, due to inappropriate message fragmentation, the realtime performance of no-wait scheduling algorithms is reduced. Therefore, in this paper, joint algorithms of message fragmentation and no-wait scheduling are proposed. First, a specification for the joint problem based on optimization modulo theories is proposed so that off-the-shelf solvers can be used to find optimal solutions. Second, to improve the scalability of our algorithm, the worst-case delay of messages is analyzed, and then, based on the analysis, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to construct low-delay schedules. Finally, we conduct extensive test cases to evaluate our proposed algorithms. The evaluation results indicate that, compared to existing algorithms, the proposed joint algorithm improves schedulability by up to 50%.

AB  - The growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices brings enormous time-sensitive applications, which require real-time transmission to effectuate communication services. The ultrareliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) scenario in the fifth generation (5G) has played a critical role in supporting services with delay-sensitive properties. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) has been widely considered as a promising paradigm for enabling the deterministic transmission guarantees for 5G. However, TSN is a hybrid traffic system with time-sensitive traffic and best effort traffic, which require effective routing and scheduling to provide a deterministic and bounded delay. While joint optimization of time-sensitive and non-time-sensitive traffic greatly increases the solution space and brings a significant challenge to obtain solutions. Therefore, this article proposes a graph convolutional network-based deep reinforcement learning (GCN-based DRL) solution for the joint optimization problem in practical communication scenarios. The GCN is integrated into deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to obtain the network’s spatial dependence and elevate the generalization performance of the proposed method. Specifically, the GCN adopts the first-order Chebyshev polynomial to approximate the graph convolution kernel, which reduces the complexity of the algorithm and improves the feasibility for the joint optimization task. Furthermore, priority experience replay is employed to accelerate the convergence speed of the model training process. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed GCN-based DRL algorithm has good convergence and outperforms the benchmark methods in terms of the average end-to-end delay.

AB  - Real-time communications characterized by low-latency, deterministic, and reliable behavior are crucial for the advancement of emerging technologies. Consequently, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has been developed to address the distinct demands of sectors such as automation and autonomous vehicles applications. This is currently achieved through various methods that emphasize the scheduling of critical data traffic. However, many of these methods determine routes independently, potentially impacting the schedulability of transmissions. Additionally, there is a noticeable lack of emphasis on the scheduling and routing of low-priority transmissions within TSN. In this paper, we introduce the Optimized Hybrid Deterministic Scheduling and Routing (OHDSR) approach. This method takes into account the priority of communications to jointly optimize the scheduling and routing of Time-Triggered (TT) communications, while also catering to low-priority Best-Effort (BE) communications. Extensive experimental evaluations show the high efficiency of our proposed method. It ensures not only the prompt delivery of TT communications but also the delivery of BE communications within suitable time frames, with a maximum difference of 14.29% from TT communications, meeting their respective deadlines. Moreover, the evaluation demonstrates the high scalability of the proposed approach, providing improved response times compared to the latest work for both routing and scheduling. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Compliance with the end-to-end latency of tasks and flows is a safety-relevant constraint in real-time systems. Especially when tasks and flows are interconnected by data dependencies in so-called Cause-Effect Chains, the adherence to end-to-end restrictions becomes even more complex. In our previous work, we proposed the incremental algorithm ITANS, which presents a solution for the joint scheduling of tasks and flows organized in Cause-Effect-Chains in communication networks applying the IEEE 802.1Qbv Time-Aware Shaper. In this work, we extend the approach to communication networks using the scheduling method Strict Priority (SP). The determination of the worst-case transmission time (WCTT) of flows is an essential part of ITANS. To derive the WCTT of flows in SP-based networks, we use the mathematical framework Network Calculus (NC) combining existing analyses to derive the least pessimistic delay guarantees for network flows. The evaluations show that the extension of ITANS can achieve a high success rate and a low runtime on average in systems with Gigabit Ethernet and communication networks that use SP.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a set of amendments that extend Ethernet to support distributed safety-critical and real-time applications in the industrial automation, aerospace, and automotive areas. TSN integrates multiple traffic types and supports interactions in several combinations. In this article, we consider the configuration supporting scheduled traffic (ST) based on gate-control lists, audio–video bridging (AVB) traffic according to IEEE 802.1BA that has bounded latencies, and best-effort traffic, for which no guarantees are provided. This article extends the timing analysis method to multiple AVB classes and proofs the credit bounds for multiple classes of AVB traffic, respectively, under frozen and nonfrozen behaviors of credit during guard band (GB). They are prerequisites for nonoverflow credits of credit-based shaper (CBS) and preventing starvation of AVB traffic. Moreover, this article proposes an improved timing analysis method reducing the pessimism for the worst-case end-to-end delays of AVB traffic by considering the limitations from the physical link rate and the output of CBS. Finally, we evaluate the improved analysis method on both synthetic and real-world test cases, showing the significant reduction of pessimism on latency bounds compared to related work and presenting the correctness validation compared with simulation results. We also compare the AVB latency bounds in the case of frozen and nonfrozen credit during GB. Additionally, we evaluate the scalability of our method with variation of the load of ST flows and of the bandwidth reservation for AVB traffic.

AB  - We compute bounds on end-to-end worst-case latency and on nodal backlog size for a per-class deterministic network that implements Credit Based Shaper (CBS) and Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS), as proposed by the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standardization group. ATS is an implementation of the Interleaved Regulator, which reshapes traffic in the network before admitting it into a CBS buffer, thus avoiding burstiness cascades. Due to the interleaved regulator, traffic is reshaped at every switch, which allows for the computation of explicit delay and backlog bounds. Furthermore, we obtain a novel, tight per-flow bound for the response time of CBS, when the input is regulated, which is smaller than existing network calculus bounds. We also compute a per-flow bound on the response time of the interleaved regulator. Based on all the above results, we compute bounds on the per-class backlogs. Then, we use the newly computed delay bounds along with recent results on interleaved regulators from literature to derive tight end-to-end latency bounds and show that these are less than the sums of per-switch delay bounds.

AB  - Industrie 4.0 reinforces advanced technology development to realize Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) with real-time guarantees. The evolution of traditional industrial- automation systems such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) to cyber-physical systems by means of virtualization is one of the key enhancements. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of the placement of virtual PLCs (vPLCs) at edge clouds in conjunction with scheduling and routing of Time-Triggered (TT) traffic in 802.1Qbv-based industrial networks. We propose two approaches to solve this problem adopting a multi-objective optimization model. In the first approach, we solve separately the problem of placement and scheduling-routing by using a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation. While in the second approach, we propose a Simulated Annealing (SA)- based meta-heuristic to solve the joint placement, scheduling, and routing optimization problem. We compare both the algorithms for real-world test cases and validate our solutions using the OMNeT++ simulator.

AB  - Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of standards aimed at providing real-time guarantees over existing Ethernet standards. Worst-case traversal time (WCTT) analyses of network traffic are traditionally used in schedulability and routing analyses to determine feasible routes for traffic streams. However, worst-case conditions happen quite rarely from a probabilistic perspective. The typical or average-case traversal times are easier to compute and can be used as an effective design tool for routing and scheduling. In this paper, we present "MaLoC" or Maximally Loaded Common links for routing and scheduling of rate-constrained (RC) traffic in time-sensitive networks (TSN). The proposed framework employs a fully decentralized approach to route and schedule generation with only switch-local information. We further provide a preliminary evaluation of the proposed approach using a simple network topology.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) has emerged as a promising standard for real-time domains. Efficiently determining critical configuration parameters for latency guarantees for time-critical flows remains an open question. Current configuration approaches rely on optimization methods with real-time performance analysis feedback to ensure deadline quality-of-service requirements. However, the ex-post verification-based optimization methods require exhaustive traversal of the entire network search space, leading to significant time consumption. This article proposes a novel, fast, and scalable deadline-aware method for configuring minimum bandwidth allocation for stream reservation (SR) classes in the TSN network, while guaranteeing deadline requirements for all time-critical traffic. We provide formal proof of our approach, which configures critical parameters in a real-time network with prior performance guarantees, thus reducing computational complexity. The analytical method is evaluated on synthetic cases, comparing it with state-of-the-art solutions to demonstrate validity and correctness. Moreover, an adapted real-world case shows the method's scalability, and minimum bandwidth reservations with guaranteed local deadlines for SR classes on all egress ports of the network can be achieved in seconds.

AB  - Recent developments in industrial automation and in-vehicle communication have raised the requirements of real-time networking. Bus systems that were traditionally deployed in these fields cannot provide sufficient bandwidth and are now shifting towards Ethernet for their real-time communication needs. In this field, standardization efforts from the IEEE and the IETF have developed new data plane mechanisms such as shapers and schedulers, as well as control plane mechanisms such as reservation protocols to support their new requirements. However, their implementation and their optimal configuration remain an important factor for their efficiency. This work presents a machine learning framework that takes on the configuration task. Four different models are trained for the configuration of per-hop latency guarantees in a distributed resource reservation process and compared with respect to their real-time traffic capacity. The evaluation shows that all models provide good configurations for the provided scenarios, but more importantly, they represent a first step for a semi-automated configuration of parameters in Time-Sensitive Networking.

AB  - The IEEE 802.1 TSN working group published a set of standards which adds new functionalities to switched Ethernet networks. These new functionalities notably aim at making the design of deterministic Ethernet networks possible, enabling their use for real-time applications. This determinism comes however at the cost of a greatly increased complexity in configuration effort, especially for largescale networks. In addition, this new complexity also affects the network simulation tools that are commonly used when designing such networks. As most of the existing ones only partially support new TSN functionalities, one has often to combine several simulators for achieving a reliable TSN network design. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach which aims at assisting the design of TSN networks. Modeling allows the creation of a formal representation of the network which can then be used to automatically generate configurations. This approach has been successfully implemented as a TSN configuration software called MoBACT, that enables the use of multiple simulation/emulation tools during the design phase by generating configurations for different targets for easing crosscheck of simulation results. Since each generated configuration is derived from the same representation of the network, our approach guarantees the consistency of the different configurations generated for each tool.

AB  - Recently, there has been an interest from the automotive industry in a novel single-pair, half-duplex Ethernet multidrop provision (i.e., 10BASE-T1S), which relies on a coordinated channel access method provided by Physical Layer Collision Avoidance (PLCA). PLCA avoids frame collisions and provides bounded latency, while guaranteeing fairness among nodes and optimal bandwidth utilization. However, despite these advantageous features, PLCA is not aware of flow priorities and, consequently, does not provide priority-based Quality of Service (QoS). Thus, there is an opportunity for integrating QoS-aware schemes, such as the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)-based Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) algorithm, into PLCA. In this paper, we present modeling and analysis strategies using Network Calculus for integrating TAS with PLCA to support scheduled traffic, and we compare our modeling and analysis with a baseline work which previously modeled TAS for full-duplex point-to-point Ethernet only. We show that replacing full-duplex point-to-point links with half-duplex PLCA multidrop links still complies with end-to-end delay deadlines, while leading to a reduction of system costs due to the fewer number of Ethernet transceivers in a PLCA multidrop. Moreover, we also show that our results for TAS, when applied only on full-duplex point-to-point links, outperform the results of the baseline work in most use cases.

AB  - The traffic scheduling problems of in-vehicle electronic and electrical architectures are closely related to the reliability and real-time performance of in-vehicle communication. In order to solve the application problem of time-sensitive network (TSN) communication in the actual vehicle scene, a method of establishing the vehicle time sensitive network model is proposed. A traffic scheduling strategy based on the time shaping mechanism (TAS) is designed for the transmission of multiple types of information flows in the network architecture, and a low-latency and highly reliable traffic scheduling scheme is obtained by using a genetic algorithm. Finally, the feasibility of the scheduling strategy is demonstrated through simulation experiments. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Network elements (e.g., switches), which intermit service, i.e., stop forwarding and transmission of data according to a repeating schedule, can be found in many real-time capable communication networks, e.g., communication networks with TDMA, Ethernet with Time-aware Shapers or low-power wireless networks. The behavior of those network elements depends on the (stationary) properties of the network elements, their schedule, and the current time, as well as the offered traffic load. If a networked real-time system generates traffic flows which are not synchronized to the schedules of the network elements, formal frameworks such as Network Calculus (NC) are highly valuable to derive deterministic guarantees for the communication. In this paper, we show the fundamental implications of modeling time-triggered network elements with service intermittence in NC. We identify two archetypes of network elements with intermittent service, and propose time-variant and time-invariant approaches to derive service curve formulations to model them. We evaluate the differences between time-variant and time-invariant service curves with respect to the overestimation of worst-case backlog and worst-case delay, and we identify schedule properties which influence the tightness of the derived bounds. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Deterministic latency is an urgent demand to pursue the continuous increase in intelligence in several real-time applications, such as connected vehicles and automation industries. A time-sensitive network (TSN) is a new framework introduced to serve these applications. Several functions are defined in the TSN standard to support time-triggered (TT) requirements, such as IEEE 802.1Qbv and IEEE 802.1Qbu for traffic scheduling and preemption mechanisms, respectively. However, implementing strict timing constraints to support scheduled traffic can miss the needs of unscheduled real-time flows. Accordingly, more relaxed scheduling algorithms are required. In this paper, we introduce the flexible window-overlapping scheduling (FWOS) algorithm that optimizes the overlapping among TT windows by three different metrics: the priority of overlapping, the position of overlapping, and the overlapping ratio (OR). An analytical model for the worst-case end-to-end delay (WCD) is derived using the network calculus (NC) approach considering the relative relationships between window offsets for consecutive nodes and evaluated under a realistic vehicle use case. While guaranteeing latency deadline for TT traffic, the FWOS algorithm defines the maximum allowable OR that maximizes the bandwidth available for unscheduled transmission. Even under a non-overlapping scenario, less pessimistic latency bounds have been obtained using FWOS than the latest related works. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - With the interconnection of distributed devices from different industrial automation networks, heterogeneous traffics with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements increase dramatically. Shapers in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) enable the coexistence of different industrial traffics within a single network infrastructure. In this paper, with full consideration of the time-criticality of different industrial traffics and shaping mechanisms, we propose a network calculus-based modeling scheme for the widely-used Credit Based Shaper (CBS) and Time Aware Shaper (TAS). Then, we analyze the QoS of industrial traffics with different real-time characteristics by CBS and TAS, respectively. To evaluate the accuracy of network calculus-based modeling scheme, we compare our theoretical analysis with simulations, wherein a compactness function is defined to describe QoS compactness. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of proposed modeling scheme, by which we further validate both CBS and TAS can satisfy the QoS of traffics for different industrial automation scenarios.

AB  - A homogeneous avionic communication architecture based on the AFDX supporting mixed-criticality applications will bring significant advantages, i.e., easier maintenance and reduced costs. To cope with this emerging issue, the AFDX may integrate multiple traffic classes: Safety-Critical Traffic (SCT) with hard real-time constraints, Rate-Constrained (RC) traffic requiring bounded latencies and Best Effort (BE) traffic with no delivery constraints. These traffic classes are managed based on a Non-Preemptive Strict Priority (NP-SP) Scheduler, where the highest priority traffic (SCT) is shaped with a Burst Limiting Shaper (BLS). The latter has been defined by the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group to limit the impact of high priority flows on lower priority ones. This paper proposes a Network Calculus-based approach to compute the end-to-end delay bounds of SCT and RC classes. We consider the impact of the BLS and the multi-hop network architecture. We also provide proofs of service curves guaranteed to SCT and RC classes, needed to derive delay bounds with Network Calculus. The proposed approach is evaluated on a realistic AFDX configuration. Results show the efficiency of incorporating the TSN/BLS on top of a NP-SP scheduler in the AFDX to noticeably enhance the RC delay bounds while guaranteeing the SCT deadline, in comparison to an AFDX implementing only a NP-SP scheduler.

AB  - For time-sensitive networks, as in the context of IEEE TSN and IETF Detnet, cyclic dependencies are associated with certain fundamental properties such as improving availability and decreasing reconfiguration effort. Nevertheless, the existence of cyclic dependencies can cause very large latency bounds or even global instability, thus making the proof of the timing predictability of such networks a much more challenging issue. Cyclic dependencies can be removed by reshaping flows inside the network, by means of regulators. We consider FIFO-per-class networks with two types of regulators: perflow regulators and interleaved regulators (the latter reshape entire flow aggregates). Such regulators come with a hardware cost that is less for an interleaved regulator than for a perflow regulator; both can affect the latency bounds in different ways. We analyze the benefits of both types of regulators in partial and full deployments in terms of latency. First, we propose Low-Cost Acyclic Network (LCAN), a new algorithm for finding the optimum number of regulators for breaking all cyclic dependencies. Then, we provide another algorithm, Fixed- Point Total Flow Analysis (FP-TFA), for computing end-to-end delay bounds for general topologies, i.e., with and without cyclic dependencies. An extensive analysis of these proposed algorithms was conducted on generic grid topologies. For these test networks, we find that FP-TFA computes small latency bounds; but, at a medium to high utilization, the benefit of regulators becomes apparent. At high utilization or for high line transmission-rates, a small number of per-flow regulators has an effect on the latency bound larger than a small number of interleaved regulators. Moreover, interleaved regulators need to be placed everywhere in the network to provide noticeable improvements. We validate the applicability of our approaches on a realistic industrial timesensitive network.

AB  - Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) is an evolving group of IEEE standards for deterministic real-time communication making standard Ethernet technology applicable to safety-critical application domains such as manufacturing or automotive systems. TSN includes several mechanisms influencing the timely forwarding of traffic, in particular, a time-triggered scheduling mechanism called time-aware shaper (TAS) and frame preemption to reduce the blocking time of high-priority traffic by low-priority traffic. Although these mechanisms have been standardized and products implementing them begin to enter the market, it is still hard for practitioners to select and apply suitable mechanisms fitting the problem at hand. For instance, TAS schedules can be calculated for individual streams or classes of traffic, and frame preemption with strict priority scheduling (w/o TAS) might seem to be an option in networks with extremely high data rates. In this paper, we make a first step towards assisting practitioners in making an informed decision when choosing between stream-based TAS, class-based TAS, and frame preemption by comparing these mechanisms in selected scenarios using our TSN network simulation tool NeSTiNg. Moreover, to facilitate the application of class-based TAS, we derive a formula for calculating class-based TAS configuration. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an industry-standard networking protocol that is widely deployed in safety-critical industrial and automotive networks thanks to its quality-of-service (QoS) mechanisms, esp. deterministic transmission and bounded end-to-end delay for time-triggered (TT) flows. In this article, we focus on TT flows and address the issue of fault tolerance against permanent and transient faults with both spatial and temporal redundancy. We present an efficient heuristic algorithm for online incremental rerouting and rescheduling of disrupted flows, assuming the paths and schedules of existing flows stay fixed. It is complementary to and can be combined with offline routing and scheduling algorithms for achieving fault tolerance based on frame replication and elimination for reliability (FRER) (IEEE 802.1CB). Performance evaluation shows that our approach is able to better recover the system’s degree of redundancy (DoR) and has a higher acceptance rate than related work.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Deterministic Networking (DetNet) technologies are increasingly recognized as key levers of the future 5G transport networks (TNs) due to their capabilities for providing deterministic Quality-of-Service and enabling the coexistence of critical and best-effort services. Additionally, they rely on programmable and cost-effective Ethernet-based forwarding planes. This article addresses the flow allocation problem in 5G backhaul networks realized as asynchronous TSN networks, whose building block is the Asynchronous Traffic Shaper. We propose an offline solution, dubbed “Next Generation Transport Network Optimizer” (NEPTUNO), that combines exact optimization methods and heuristic techniques and leverages data analytics to solve the flow allocation problem. NEPTUNO aims to maximize the flow acceptance ratio while guaranteeing the deterministic Quality-of-Service requirements of the critical flows. We carried out a performance evaluation of NEPTUNO regarding the degree of optimality, execution time, and flow rejection ratio. Furthermore, we compare NEPTUNO with a novel online baseline solution for two different optimization goals. Online methods compute the flow's allocation configuration right after the flow arrives at the network, whereas offline solutions like NEPTUNO compute a long-term configuration allocation for the whole network. Our results highlight the potential of data analytics for the self-optimization of the future 5G TNs.

AB  - As substations become increasingly intelligent, a growing disparity arises between the surge in network traffic and the real-time transmission demands of critical communication services. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) offers the capability to shape, schedule, and synchronize data flows, thereby enhancing the transmission quality of time-critical services. We propose a TSN-based intelligent substation traffic scheduling scheme. The transmission delay boundary of substation messages under TSN is calculated based on network calculus theory. The Omnet++ network simulation platform is used for case analysis. Simulation results reveal that, with static configuration of gate control lists, this traffic scheduling approach ensures ultra-low latency and zero jitter for sampled value message transmissions, while concurrently ensuring real-time transmission for all other communication services.

AB  - This work presents a proven per-hop latency bound for real-time networks with admission control that does not rely on shaping or timed gates. It can be applied in a distributed control plane using only bridge-local information, making it an ideal candidate for brownfield real-time network installations. A brief comparison with Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) shows that the achieved network utilization is comparable to that of ATS in some scenarios, while it only lags behind in scenarios with accumulating bursts where re-shaping could actually reduce the interference of the observed streams. © 2020 IFIP.

AB  - ARINC 664, which is a heavily used protocol for modern avionics networks, is preferred due to its simplicity although its mixed-criticality support is limited. Time Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet), and IEEE Time Sensitive Networking (TSN), which utilize time synchronized schedule, are more suitable for supporting mixed-criticality applications; however, both require a fault tolerant time synchronization that makes the certification process more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic priority assignment (DPA) concept together with the burst limiting shaper (BLS) from the IEEE TSN standard to enhance the schedulability and the mixed-criticality support of ARINC 664. The decision of flow re-assignment to a new priority class is done by calculating the high priority (HP) and low priority (LP) class worst-case delays using the network calculus framework. The numerical results show that the class utilization rates can be significantly increased by using the DPA concept with and without the BLS while the deadline constraints for all classes are satisfied. Thus, the DPA can improve the schedulability and mixed-criticality of ARINC 664 without using any time synchronization mechanism.

AB  - Owning to the sub-standards being developed by IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group, the traditional IEEE 802.1 Ethernet is enhanced to support real-time dependable communications for future time- and safety-critical applications. Several sub-standards have been recently proposed that introduce various traffic shapers (e.g., Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), Asynchronous Traffic Shaper (ATS), Credit-Based Shaper (CBS), Strict Priority (SP)) for flow control mechanisms of queuing and scheduling, targeting different application requirements. These shapers can be used in isolation or combination and there is limited work that analyzes, evaluates, and compares their performance, which makes it challenging for end-users to choose the right combination for their applications. This paper aims at (i) quantitatively comparing various traffic shapers and their combinations, (ii) summarizing, classifying, and extending the architectures of individual and combined traffic shapers and their Network calculus (NC)-based performance analysis methods, and (iii) filling the gap in the timing analysis research on handling ATS and CBS used for different priority queues, and two novel hybrid architectures of combined traffic shapers, i.e., TAS+ATS+SP and TAS+ATS+CBS when ATS and CBS used at the same queue. A large number of experiments, using both synthetic and realistic test cases, are carried out for quantitative performance comparisons of various individual and combined traffic shapers, from the perspective of upper bounds of delay, backlog, and jitter. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to quantitatively compare the performance of the main traffic shapers in TSN. The paper aims at supporting the researchers and practitioners in the selection of suitable TSN sub-protocols for their use cases.

AB  - In many emerging Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) applications such as industrial control and automotive, periodic traffic with end-to-end latency constraints is buffered with nonmission-critical aperiodic traffic. As queueing delay is a central component of end-to-end latency, we study the effect of aperiodic traffic on the queueing delay of periodic traffic via characterizing the probability distribution of queue size and delay in an (M + D)/M/1 queue, a queue with Poisson and periodic inputs, infinite waiting capacity and a single memoryless server. Since obtaining the closed form distributions of the queue size and delay is intractable, we approximate the behavior of the (M + D)/M/1 queue when the service and arrival rates are close. We use a Markov chain with a quasitoeplitz matrix, enabling us to use an existing technique to study this class of Markov chains. We determine the transition matrix of the Markov chain, investigate the setting in which the approximation works well, and compute the stationary distribution. We plot and compare the stationary distributions of queue size and delay between the (M + D)/M/1 queue and our model; we observe that our model is a favorable match.

AB  - This paper presents the latest Ethernet standardization of in-vehicle network and the future trends of automotive Ethernet technology. The proposed system provides design and optimization algorithms for automotive networking technology related to AVB (Audio Video Bridge) technology. We present a design of in-vehicle network system as well as the optimization of AVB for automotive. A proposal of Reduced Latency of Machine to Machine (RLMM) plays an outstanding role in reducing the latency among devices. RLMM's approach to real-world experimental cases indicates a reduction in latency of around 41.2%. The setup optimized for the automotive network environment is expected to significantly reduce the time in the development and design process. The results obtained in the study of image transmission latency are trustworthy because average values were collected over a long period of time. It is necessary to analyze a latency between multimedia devices within limited time which will be of considerable benefit to the industry. Furthermore, the proposed reliable camera and video streaming through optimized AVB device settings would provide a high level of support in the real-time comprehension and analysis of images with AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithms in autonomous driving. © 2021 KSII

AB  - Time sensitive networks support deterministic schedules over Ethernet networks. Due to their high determinism, high reliability and high bandwidth, they have been considered as a good choice for the backbone network of industrial internet of things. In industrial applications, the backbone network connects multiple industrial field networks together and has to carry massive real-time packets. However, the off-the-shelf time-sensitive network (TSN) switches can deterministically schedule no more than 1024 real-time flows due to the limited number of schedule table entries. The excess real-time flows have to be delivered by best-effort services because the switch only supports the two scheduling services. The best-effort services can reduce average delay, but cannot guarantee the hard real-time constraints of industrial applications. To make the limited number of schedule table entries support more real-time flows, first, we relax scheduling rules to reduce the requirement for schedule table entries and formulate the process of transmitting packets as a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) specification. Then, we divide the SMT specification into multiple optimization modulo theories (OMT) specifications so that the execution time of solvers can be reduced to an acceptable range. Second, we propose fast heuristic algorithms that combine schedule tables and packet injection control to eliminate scheduling conflicts. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations. The evaluation results indicate that, compared to existing algorithms, our proposed algorithm requires only one-twentieth the number of schedule entries to schedule the same flow set.

AB  - In order to improve the conflict between real-time needs and data flow of business in smart grid, this paper proposes a scheme for optimizing traffic scheduling using time-sensitive network technology for smart grid, especially smart substations. A smart substation incorporates a switch with TSN properties to separate network traffic into time-sensitive and non-time-sensitive streams., allocate the matching time slot window for different flow, and preempt frames in the MAC layer. This scheme can reduce the queue scheduling delay of time-sensitive flow, realize the optimization of scheduling of traffic on the transmission route, and fulfill the criteria of intelligent substations by ensuring minimal delay variation and a minimal rate of data loss during the transmission of control signals and collected data.

Under cyclic queuing and forwarding (CQF) with preemption, this letter analyzes the traffic transmission process and defines the traffic classes. Then, this letter provides a schedulability analysis on streams of all traffic classes. The results can provide the network designers with guidelines in the configuration under CQF with preemption and accelerate the usage of TSN for safety-critical communication scenarios.

AB  - 5G+ deterministic network plays important role in the power system. Time sensitive network(TSN) related technologies meet the real time transmission of time-triggered power flows. In this paper, we firstly propose a network calculus based model for analyzing network maximum delays, which utilizing service curves and arrival curves to determine the upper threshold of TSN end-to-end delays by the time-aware shaper (TAS) mechanism. This model simplifies the evaluation of delay performance when compared to conventional random queuing methods. Secondly, since the service curve relies on the gate control list (GCL) configuration, this requires accurately calculating gate durations for different service flows and the precise open/close time for each queue. To tackle this challenge, this paper presents a GCL adaptive adjustment algorithm, which can identify the minimum of maximum delays by configuring gating parameters optimally. Thirdly, we use Matlab to analyze high-priority flow maximum delays across different GCL configurations, examining the effects of service flows, overlap times, gate open durations, and time intervals. Furthermore, we employ the OMNeT++ platform to conduct network simulations under predefined GCL gating settings. The results show that high-priority flows maintain an end-to-end delay below the optimized maximum delay value, consistently confirming the effectiveness of the proposed TSN delay analysis model and GCL adaptive adjustment algorithm.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is being widely investigated to provide Ethernet capabilities for in-vehicle backbone communication. However, the gate control list (GCL), as a simple mechanism for achieving timing determinism for safety-critical traffic (ST) frames with hard deadlines, is too rigid to handle the intrinsic timing uncertainty of automated driving systems (ADSs). Due to the complexity and the unpredictable operating environment, there can be delayed ST frames that can disrupt the solidly fixed timing behavior. In this work, we present one novel approach to effectively use bandwidth resources to deal with delayed ST frames, which cannot be handled by a traditional fixed GCL, and the discarding of them should be reduced to improve the system’s integrity. An acceptance test is implemented to report to the application layer when an ST frame will miss its deadline and hence be rejected, i.e., prevented from entering the switch. To further improve the efficiency of bandwidth usage, we investigate how to improve the performance of the more important Class A frames in an audio-video-bridging (AVB) switch, which adopts a credit-based shaper mechanism, and we propose a constant bandwidth server to replace the credit-based shaper while taking fairness into consideration. Evaluation with extensive experiments shows that both resilience and efficiency of the TSN are significantly enhanced compared with a credit-based shaper, especially when the traffic load is relatively high. For the delayed ST frames and event-triggered traffic, our approach is able to schedule more than the solution using the AVB switch even with a high network load.

AB  - There is a demand of high bandwidth in the emerging real-time applications, such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and industrial automation, where time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a promising solution. According to IEEE 802.1, a port in a TSN switch has eight prioritized FIFO (first-in first-out) queues, whose gates are opened or closed following a gate control list (GCL). Most of the existing works use one TT (time-triggered) queue for the hard real-time traffic, i.e., traffic flows with hard deadlines, which easily achieves timing determinism through GCL. Unfortunately, as a rigid mechanism, GCL is not able to handle timing jitter. In this work, we propose a hybrid strategy towards robust TSN. GCL is applied to only one queue named TT T1 for a small number of hard real-time flows with negligible jitter. The remaining flows with hard deadlines are allocated to a prioritized queue named TT T2 without GCL. Similarly, GCL is removed from all other queues handling AVB (audio-video-bridging) flows with soft deadlines and BE (best-effort) flows with no deadlines. Two analyses are proposed to obtain delay bounds for the TT T2 flows and periodic AVB flows, respectively, with interference from TT T1. Although safety is not compromised if the periodic AVB flows miss their deadlines, it is often desirable in practice to satisfy them for quality of service. In order to strike a balance, contention between the AVB queues is resolved with credit values on top of priorities. Experiments support that the delay bounds for the TT T2 and AVB flows are safe. In addition, changing the credit function can lead to different delay bounds of AVB flows, which is valuable for real-world configurations of TSN.

AB  - Time-sensitive software-defined networking (TSSDN) is an emerging technology that combines the real-time network configuration capabilities of software-defined networking (SDN) with the deterministic flow delivery capabilities of time-sensitive networking (TSN), making it ideal for use in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, as data flows generated by industrial applications grow exponentially, it is challenging to achieve low-latency and reliable data flow transmission at the same time in TSSDN due to the limited network resources. To address this issue, we propose the adoption of the frame replication and elimination for reliability (FRER) mechanism in TSSDN-based IIoT systems. However, it is important to acknowledge that the FRER mechanism introduces stress on the already restricted network resources by generating redundant paths. In light of this concern, we construct an end-to-end delay bound model and a reliability model to analyze this issue. To mitigate the stress imposed on the network, we formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the overall system utility while adhering to the transmission requirements of business flows and the limitations of hardware resources. Consequently, we devise an algorithm for reliability-enhanced flow routing and scheduling, which effectively solves the aforementioned optimization problem. To validate the effectiveness and performance of our proposed algorithm, we conduct numerical simulations on four data sets. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing methods.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) provides mechanisms for strictly controlling network latency, jitter, and packet loss in LAN environments. These technologies enable various applications, including industrial automation and professional audio/video bridging. Current TSN network architectures heavily rely on a centralized control model inspired by Software-Defined Networking (SDN). While this approach works well for small-scale L2 TSN networks, it is not feasible for larger-scale L3 deterministic networks involving multiple network segments and routers. This paper proposes and evaluates distributed mech-anisms for Deterministic Networking (DetNet) that enable: i) the discovery of priority queue information using a link-state protocol or an exploration-based approach, ii) the planning of network paths using network calculus based on available queue information, and iii) a distributed signaling mechanism for configuring the data plane of the deterministic network. Simulations demonstrate the potential of these protocols in large-scale networks and validate their bounded delay and packet loss.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a promising solution for the next generation in-vehicle networks. To enable innovations in adaptability, there is a strong trend to integrate TSN with Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Software-defined TSN requires fast routing algorithms that guarantee the Worst-Case End-to-End Delay (WCED) of the Audio Video Bridging (AVB) flows. However, current AVB flow routing algorithms execute WCED analysis for an exponential amount of route candidates, which is not feasible at run-time. Current WCED analysis of the AVB flows depends on the specific flow setup of other traffic classes. When high-priority flows change, low-priority flows must be adjusted as well to maintain deadline guarantees. In this paper, we propose a per-class flow management scheme to enable run-time routing of the AVB flows. Our composable analysis computes a formal WCED bound of the AVB flows. It does not rely on the flow setup of other traffic classes. So, the WCED and routes can be computed for each traffic class independently and in parallel. Based on the analysis, we develop a fast heuristic algorithm to incrementally route the AVB flows with guaranteed deadlines. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to the existing solutions, the composable analysis is 2.6x faster. The cost is that the WCED bound can be up to 31% higher. When given a similar run-time as existing solutions, the proposed routing algorithm can set up 1.6x more flows. The average time to set up one flow is within 0.14s.

AB  - The IEEE 802.1 Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group is devoted to improving deterministic delay during data communication. To schedule traffic in TSN, Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) has been introduced to guarantee bounded maximum delays without complicated time synchronization, and Urgency Based Scheduler (UBS) becomes the default implementation for ATS. However, due to the traffic fluctuation, UBS cannot achieve best delay bounds if some parameters are not configured appropriately in real time. What is more, UBS needs to consumes excessive butter resources, which prevents TSN from being deployed in real world. To solve these problems, we propose Time Sensitive Queuing (TSQ), a novel ATS mechanism. TSQ lowers the difficulty of TSN deployment by removing the parameter that need to be configured in real time. In addition, to reduce the butter consumption, TSQ applies time-slot-based packet allocation mechanism as the enqueue strategy, and time-slot-based packet polling mechanism as the dequeue strategy, respectively. Our Network Calculus analysis shows that TSQ can provide bounded delays and up to 40% butter resource reduction compared to UBS. The extensive experiments implemented in ns-3 show that TSQ consumes 33% less butter resource compared to UBS.

AB  - Industrial automation networks are composed of cyber-physical systems where frame delays and jitter influence significantly the quality of communication between control and field devices. Due to these constraints, such systems are often served by dedicated Fieldbus networks which are different from networks for enterprise-level connectivity. However, with the introduction of Time-sensitive Networking standards which are already integrated into IEEE 802.1Q-2018 standards in essential parts, the long expected single converged network for any-type communication in the field, control, and enterprise level is within reach. With it, comes the challenge of synthesizing schedules to obtain parameters for configuring the network bridges for time-triggered communication services.This paper provides a scheduling verification, and Gate Control event computation algorithm focused on asserting the viability of scheduling communication services for multiple independent periodic Talker applications on IEEE 802.1Q- Time Sensitive Networks as well as the computation of Gate Control Lists for the bridges.

AB  - Ethernet AVB is being actively considered by the automotive industry as a candidate for in-vehicle communication backbone. However, several questions pertaining to schedulability of hard real-time messages transmitted via such a switch remain unanswered. In this paper, we attempt to fill this void. We derive equations to perform worst-case response time analysis on Ethernet AVB switches by considering its credit-based shaping algorithm. Also, we propose several approaches to reduce the pessimism in the analysis to provide tighter bounds.

AB  - The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) set of standards introduces in IEEE 802.1 switches and end stations novel features to meet the requirements of a broad spectrum of applications that are characterized by time-sensitive and mission-critical traffic flows. In particular, the IEEE802.1Qbv-2015 amendment introduces enhancements that provide temporal isolation for scheduled traffic, i.e., a traffic class that requires transmission based on a known timescale, while the IEEE802.1Qbu-2016 introduces preemption as a mechanism to allow time-critical messages to interrupt ongoing non time-critical transmissions. Both amendments, that are now enrolled in the IEEE802.1Q-2018 standard, are very important for industrial networks, where scheduled traffic and low-latency real-time flows have to coexist, on the same network, with best-effort transmissions. In this context, this work presents a response time analysis of TSN networks that encompasses the enhancements for scheduled traffic and preemption, in various combinations. The paper presents the proposed analysis and a performance comparison between the response times calculated by the analysis and the response times obtained through OMNeT++ simulations in three different scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Nowadays, most of cyber-physical systems in avionics, automotive or recent Industry 4.0 domains require networked communication for mixed-critical applications. Ethernet-based networks such as AFDX, TTEthernet or TSN are capable to support transmission of both safety-critical and non-critical flows. This paper focuses on the TTEthernet network compliant with the avionics ARINC 664-P7 standard supporting time-triggered communication (TT) together with rate-constrained (RC) and best-effort (BE) traffic. Due to a global synchronization, TT communication with low latency and minimal jitter is ensured with static schedules computed offline. For event-triggered RC flows, bounded jitter at the source and end-to-end latency are guaranteed with worst-case analysis methods. With the increasing demands of applications, flows with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements such as video or audio may be transmitted as BE flows. However, on current configurations, no guarantees are offered to BE flows. In this paper, we aim at increasing the maximum RC utilization and improving the QoS of BE flows to allow the transmission of video or audio traffic with low jitter and end-to-end delay requirements. For this, we focus on the scheduling mechanisms and propose a scheduling approach based on a static slotted table that is applied at end systems. This table integrates the TT schedules usually obtained with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) approaches and establishes offsets of RC flows that reduce the end-to-end delay of BE flows. Several strategies for offset computations are proposed based on the distribution of flows locally at end system or globally at switch. We show that local strategies perform better than the global ones to reduce end-to-end delay of BE flows.

AB  - The Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) network systems confront bandwidth resource sharing challenge constantly, with the objective to obey strict timing requirements. In traditional avionics network, the deterministic QoS guarantees are maintained by precise offline configuration during the design period. However, considering the increasing flexibility and variable scale of avionics systems in recent years, it is inevitable to develop a new network framework that can adapt to scalability. Thus, a Software Defined Networking (SDN)-based avionics network is explored to reduce the complexity and integration overheads for upgrading, which must meet bandwidth and end-to-end latency requirements both. SDN possesses the advantages with global visibility and flexibility management of flows for safety critical applications, but it could not support real-time guarantee for traffic transmission in the network. Nevertheless, the centralized SDN can be an effective implement to combine SDN and bandwidth resource allocation for Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) in avionics network. And it is revealed that the Time Aware Shaper (TAS) and Credit Based Shaper (CBS) play key roles in bandwidth allocation for TSN to obtain deterministic traffic transmission behaviors, which also shows great interests to automotive and industrial communications. In this paper, we first propose a SDN-based framework for traffic bandwidth allocation in avionics network, which can significantly enhance bandwidth reservation management during real-time network communication. Then, we introduce a heuristic algorithm to resolve traffic bandwidth allocation problem, and derive multiple scheduling constraints to support traffic transmission with low and bounded latency and further ensure safety-critical communication. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate our method, and we also discuss trade-offs to optimize the required calculation time, thus can be flexible adopted in safety-critical and time-sensitive applications.

AB  - The current automotive industry has a growing demand for real-time transmission to support reliable communication and for key technologies. The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) working group introduced standards for reliable communication in time-critical systems, including shaping mechanisms for bounded transmission latency. Among these shaping mechanisms, Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) and frame preemption provide deterministic guarantees for frame transmission. However, despite some current studies on the performance analysis of CQF and frame preemption, they also need to consider the potential effects of their combined usage on frame transmission. Furthermore, there is a need for more research that addresses the impact of parameter configuration on frame transmission under different situations and shaping mechanisms, especially in the case of mechanism combination. Firstly, this paper comprehensively reviews the schedulability analysis of the combined usage of CQF and frame preemption based on Compositional Performance Analysis (CPA). This paper summarizes the Worst-Case Responses (WCRs) of streams of each class under CQF with preemption. Secondly, this paper analyses the WCR under CQF with preemption. This analysis identifies the factors that influence the transmission latency for streams of each class and proposes several guidelines in parameter configuration under this mechanism combination. Then, this paper develops a scheduler named CQFP scheduler, enabling the computation of the WCR for all streams under CQF with preemption in different network scenarios. Finally, the paper conducts simulations to obtain the WCR under various configurations, validating the guidelines and the results obtained from the CQFP scheduler. This evaluation provides insights into the performance of the combination of CQF and preemption. The results can provide the network designers detailed guidelines in traffic class assignment and parameter configuration under CQF with preemption. © 2024 SAE International. All rights reserved.

AB  - Proprietary field buses such as PROFINET IRT, EtherNet/IP, and EtherCAT are currently used to ensure realtime communication in industrial automation appliances. Despite the fact that they are mostly Ethernet-based, interoperability between them is limited or not feasible at all. In the Industry 4.0 context, the goal is to enable real-time communication with ultralow latencies, while also permitting non-critical traffic and ensuring interoperability between devices from different manufacturers. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a promising candidate to meet these requirements on layer 2 of the OSI reference model in conjunction with a suitable higher-level protocol. The IEEE 802.1 TSN Task Group has been developing extensions to the Ethernet technology to make it more deterministic and reliable since 2012. In this paper, we have evaluated the TSN mechanisms (1) Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) and (2) frame preemption (FP) and compared them to the existing strict priority scheduling (ST) mechanism in exemplary setups. The chosen comparison criteria are latency guarantee, jitter, and the influence on non-critical traffic. Since the support of TSN devices on the market is low, we have carried out the evaluation using the simulation framework OMNeT++ and the NeSTiNg library. Our evaluation shows that, all in all, TAS performs the best, but it introduces a great configuration overhead. FP and ST can keep up in certain scenarios and their performance can even be improved.

AB  - Length Rate Quotient (LRQ) is the first algorithm of interleaved shaping – a novel concept proposed to provide per-flow shaping for a flow aggregate without per-flow queuing. This concept has been adopted by Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Deterministic Networking (DetNet). In this paper, we investigate basic properties of LRQ interleaved shapers. One is the so-called “shaping-for-free” property, which is, when an LRQ interleaved shaper is appended to a FIFO system, it does not increase the worst-case delay of the system. The other basic properties include conformance, output characterization, a sufficient and necessary condition for bounded delay, Guaranteed Rate characterization, and delay and backlog bounds for LRQ interleaved shapers as stand-alone elements. The derived properties of LRQ shed new insights on understanding interleaved shaping, which may be further exploited to achieve bounded delay in TSN/DetNet networks. © 2023, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), as a set of the protocols of data link layer, is proposed by the IEEE 802.1 task group to ensure the real-time and deterministic network communication. However, the computation and configuration of the synchronous TSN scheduling problem is a non-deterministic polynomial hard (NP-hard) problem. To deal with such a problem, a fast solution algorithm is proposed in this paper based on the flow-by-flow method and dynamic programming method. Firstly, the difficulty aroused from the synchronization error is analyzed and the corresponding queue and gating resources for frames are reserved to guarantee the feasibility of the solution. Secondly, the upper and lower bounds of each frame are defined such that dynamic time margin is calculated. In addition, with the above bounds, two necessary feasibility conditions for the synchronous TSN scheduling problem are given, which can judge whether the problem is feasible before the scheduling. Finally, the queue arrangement problem with complex coupling constraints is solved by dynamic programming method with the aim of minimizing end-to-end delay. The proposed algorithm is verified, and the results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in obtaining the feasible and satisfactory scheduling scheme within a short time.

AB  - Real-time switched Ethernet communication is of increasing importance in many cyber-physical and embedded systems application areas such as automotive electronics, avionics, and industrial control. The IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group develops standards for real-time Ethernet, for example a time-triggered traffic class (IEEE 802.1Qbv-2015). New application areas, such as active safety and autonomous driving using radar, lidar, and camera sensors, which do not fall into the strictly periodic, time-triggered communication model, require a flexible traffic class that can accommodate various communication models while still providing hard real-time guarantees. In our previous work, we developed such a traffic class, Urgency-Based Scheduler (UBS), and its worst-case latency analysis. UBS is currently under standardization (P802.1Qcr) in the TSN task group. In this paper, we introduce and solve the UBS synthesis problem of assigning hard real-time data flows to queues and priorities to queues, the main parameters that determine communication latencies. The synthesis problem is particularly challenging due to the flexibility offered by UBS to aggregate flows and assign individual priority levels per network hop. We present an SMT approach, a cluster-based heuristic, and an extensive experimental evaluation.

AB  - Busy period analysis is often used as a basis for worst-case response time analysis of priority based systems. However, when shaping strategies are used to prevent starvation of lower priorities, it becomes difficult to achieve tightness results using this method. The reason for this is that a busy period is defined as the longest interval in which there exists pending load. It is exclusively based on execution time, and does not take the amount of provided bandwidth into account. As a consequence, it is less suitable for the study of idling systems. In particular, we do not yet have tightness results regarding the analysis of the Ethernet AVB standard, in which credit-based shaping is applied. In this paper, we propose an alternative to the use of busy periods. We show that, by defining an eligible interval in such a way that provisioning is taken into account, tight worst-case response time bounds can more easily be obtained for Ethernet AVB, at least in the case of either lower-or higher-priority interference.

AB  - The ongoing transition in industrial automation towards a highly interconnected architecture underscores the importance of time-sensitive networking (TSN). This paper addresses the implementation of a time-predictable software-based TSN-enabled network stack for mixed criticality traffic in TSN end stations. The findings demonstrate the network stack’s worst-case execution time (WCET) analysability, effective management of mixed critical traffic, and real-time transmission of UDP frames. Additionally, the stack offers modularity, configurability, and TSN support for transferring messages across different priorities using either UDP or TCP. Evaluation on the time-predictable open-source T-CREST platform yields representative WCET estimates comparable to related research. The paper concludes by outlining further research.

AB  - In order to more accurately analyze the problem of time delay simulation and calculation in the time-sensitive network (TSN) of vehicular Ethernet, a TSN reservation class data delay analysis model improved based on the State–Action–Reward–State–Action (SARSA) reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the TSN data queue forwarding delay model and reservation class data delay analysis intelligent body model are established, then the TSN traffic scheduling mechanism is improved by the SARSA reinforcement learning algorithm, and the improved TSN network reservation class data analysis model is established for the uncertainty of traffic scheduling in the network; finally, the fitting performance of the proposed method is verified by simulation and experimental validation. The results show that the deviation between the two is less than 5% under different BE loads, i.e., the established reservation class data delay analysis model is able to correctly fit the scheduling mechanism of the vehicle-mounted TSN network, which proves the reasonableness of the model simulation. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - TSN or Time-Sensitive Network is an aggregation of standards that can include the Ethernet extension to support the real-time application while preserving the safety-critical distribution with the hardware. To improve real-time guarantees establishes multiple shaping such as Credit-Based Shaping (CBS), Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS), Burst Limiting Shaping (BLS) and scheduling processes like Time Aware Shaping (TAS) and various traffic are incorporated. In industrial applications, CBS and TAS combination are widely used. Due to increase of number of traffic in modern industries, control data traffic (CDT), are frequently transfer of the system as a consequence AVB credit are freeze very often and behavior of credit of AVB and timing are continuous changing. Analyzing of the behavior of AVB credit for different timing conditions, it can be predicted total traffic condition of different flows and optimistic shaping mechanism of CBS can enhance quality of service. Several optimal cases have been studied.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a collection of standards that extend Ethernet to support safety-critical and real-time applications. TSN integrates multiple traffic types, i.e., Time-Triggered (TT) traffic scheduled based on Gate-Control-Lists (GCLs), Audio-Video-Bridging (AVB) traffic that requires bounded latencies, and Best-Effort (BE) traffic, for which no guarantees are provided. This paper proposes a Network Calculus-based approach to determine the worst-case end-to-end delays of AVB traffic in a TSN network with both non-preemption and preemption modes. We consider the effects of TT traffic due to GCLs, "guard bands", i.e., time windows that block other traffic from transmitting, and preemption overhead on the service for AVB traffic. We provide a proof of non-overflow condition for AVB credit, which is used to control the AVB traffic transmission. The analysis method is evaluated on realistic test cases, and compared to related work.

AB  - Due to ever-increasing bandwidth requirements of modern automotive applications, Ethernet AVB is becoming a standard high-speed bus in automotive E/E architectures. Since Ethernet AVB is tailored to audio and video entertainment, existing analysis approaches neglect the specific requirements and features of heterogeneous E/E architectures and their applications. This paper presents a timing analysis technique based on Real Time Calculus to consider Ethernet AVB in complex E/E architectures, reflecting key features such as static routing and stream reservation, fixed topology, and real-time applications. A comparison with a simulation on case studies from the automotive domain gives evidence that the proposed technique delivers valuable bounds for complete sensor-to-actuator chains, enabling automatic system synthesis and design space exploration approaches.

AB  - Industrial automation is changing towards a flat and highly interconnected architecture, with requirements for end-to-end real-time enabled machine-to-machine communications. Technologies such as time-sensitive networking (TSN) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) publish-subscribe provide the necessary features. While TSN is well explored, OPC UA's execution time behavior remains unknown. This article presents findings made while extending the open62541 OPC UA Pub Sub stack with the 802.1q VLAN tag to enable IEEE 802.1Qbv time-aware scheduling. The results include end-to-end timing measures and worst-case execution time analyses considering various payloads. Time-predictable T-CREST platforms host the publisher and subscriber, and a TSN network handles message transmission. The paper concludes by outlining further research focusing on dynamic memory access, buffer management, and the inclusion of non-priority access to the Ethernet port.

AB  - End-to-end low-latency deterministic communication, next to high-reliability communication, is one of the key features that communication systems are expected to provide for industrial systems. To achieve time-sensitive networking (TSN), a set of standards have already been designed and deployed for wired industrial communication systems, coexisting or replacing other long-living technologies such as Fieldbus, Profibus, or Modbus. Wireless time-sensitive networking (W-TSN) is getting traction with the development of the newest WiFi generation (IEEE 802.11be) as well as advances in cellular networking. One of the challenges in W-TSN is scheduling and isolation of time-critical traffic in the shared wireless medium. In this paper we present a solution, called dynamic traffic classification, to give faster dedicated access to the wireless medium for packets of highly-time-sensitive flows, that can be generated randomly. Dynamic traffic classification utilizes so-called shadow queues implemented in FPGA-based WiFi baseband SDR platform, openwifi, to prioritize channel access of certain packets over others. We show that the channel access latency in the case of dynamic traffic classification does not depend on the scheduling cycle, but on the distribution of dedicated time slots inside the schedule cycle. As such we achieve to decrease the end-to-end latency by 75% in case of longer communication cycles with wider space between communication time slots.

AB  - To fulfill the real-time requirement in various scenarios, such as Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group (TG) have been proposing flow control strategies. As an implementation of per-class flow control strategy, Credit Based Shaping (CBS) space out the Audio/Video (A/V) frames to reduce bursting and bunching as well as protect A/V frames from being interfered. However, CBS provides coarse-grained service, which means the real-time performance for each flow cannot be provided individually. In this paper, we propose Token Regulated Credit Based Shaper (TRCBS), which is an extension of CBS. Unlike CBS, TRCBS operates each flow and can provide the fine-grained service. Based on simulations and evaluations operated in OMNeT++, the performance of TRCBS was qualified analyzed. Furthermore, the comparison between CBS and TRCBS was shown. And TRCBS can even provide better real-time guarantee as well as fine-grained QoS for the flows in the network.

AB  - Tight end-to-end worst-case delay bounds for periodic traffic streams are essential for time sensitive networks. In this paper, we provide an algorithm to compute a tight (and accurate) end-to-end worst-case bound by considering distinct topological patterns and the manner in which streams enter and leave switches. This refined analysis uses non-preemptive, strict-priority arbitration mechanism commonly deployed in Ethernet switches. Compared to the state-of-the-art that considers all higher and equal priority interference as contributing to the worst-case bound, we present an analytical approach for computing a tighter worst-case delay bound and prove through discrete event simulations that only a certain number of equal-priority interference streams can actually affect the worst-case case. Our results enable efficient resource allocation and have implications for online re-configuration mechanisms for time-sensitive factory communication systems.

AB  - Most of the recent researches related to hybrid traffic scheduling in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) focus on how to ensure bounded low-delay transmission for Scheduled Traffic (ST) and Stream Reservation (SR) traffic. However, if high-priority traffic blocks Best Effort (BE) traffic represented by data logging and periodic software updates for a long time, the end-to-end delay of BE messages will be too large. To reduce the blocking of SR traffic on BE traffic by reducing the reserved bandwidth for SR traffic, this paper proposes a traffic scheduling algorithm combined with ingress shaping. First, add ingress buffers before SR queues. Then, schedule SR traffic on a per-flow basis in the TSN switch by limiting the rate at which frames in each ingress buffer enter the SR queue. Finally, joint egress shaping and ingress shaping to reserve bandwidth resources that match its delay requirement for each SR flow. Simulation results show that the maximum end-to-end delay of BE messages can be reduced by 0.32%~17.19%.

AB  - To analyze the upper bound of end-to-end delay in time-sensitive networks, an improved calculation model of end-to-end transmission delay based on network calculus is derived according to the relevant knowledge of deterministic network calculus. The effects of GCL gate opening time, scheduling period, the overlap of transmission Windows, and different priorities of traffic on the delay index were analyzed experimentally, and the end-to-end worst-case transmission delay of time triggered (TT) traffic in the whole process of traffic transmission was calculated. Finally, through comprehensive analysis of GCL and reasonable configuration of parameters, good transmission capacity of the communication network is ensured, which provides a theoretical basis for efficient deployment of the communication network and optimal allocation of network resources.

AB  - Due to increasing bandwidth requirements, Ethernet technology is emerging in embedded systems application areas such as automotive, avionics, and industrial control. In the automotive domain, Ethernet enables integration of cameras, radars, and fusion to build active safety and automated driving systems. While Ethernet provides the necessary communication bandwidth, solutions are needed to satisfy stringent dependability and temporal requirements of such safety-critical systems. This paper introduces an asynchronous traffic scheduling algorithm, which gives low delay guarantees in a switched Ethernet network, while maintaining a low implementation complexity. We present a timing analysis and demonstrate the tightness of the delay bounds by extensive simulation experiments.

AB  - Recent studies leverage time-aware shaper (TAS) and frame replication and elimination for reliability (FRER) techniques to achieve deterministic latency and high reliability for time-triggered (TT) flows. FRER requires transmitting TT flows on $k$ disjoint paths to tolerate transient and permanent failures. However, directly allocating timeslot resources for all $k$ TT flows will dramatically increase the computational complexity of gate control lists (GCLs), seriously impair scheduling capabilities, and result in a wastage of bandwidth. In this paper, we propose an ultra-reliable time-aware shaper (uTAS). uTAS only allocates timeslots for one TT flow to ensure deterministic transmission. The $k - 1$ replica TT (RT) flows are delivered using a best-effort strategy. On this basis, we propose an adaptive window scheduling (AWS) algorithm based on network calculus, which aims to guarantee that RT flows reach their destinations within the deadline. Evaluation results show that uTAS can meet the flow reliability and deadline requirements. Compared to directly combining TAS and FRER (DCTF), uTAS reduces the total number of GCLs by approximately 72.9%.

AB  - No specific implementation methods of traffic scheduling have been defined in the Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) protocols. Most research on traffic scheduling algorithms in TSN is for static network traffics. In this paper, a window based scheduling algorithm adaptive to network traffic fluctuations is proposed. An optimal period for Gate Control List (GCL) is firstly derived to guarantee the schedulability of control traffics. Then a dynamic window adjustment algorithm is proposed to maximize the bandwidth of best effort traffics. A simulated network is implemented based on OMNeT++/NeSTiNg simulation framework to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm significantly improves the delay and jitter performance under dynamic traffic configuration. The time-sensitive services can be guaranteed even when the traffic changes dynamically.

AB  - The existing in-vehicle networks are not capable of accommodating increased data in vehicle and the demand of bandwidth. Next generation networks require higher bandwidth and shorter latency. Therefore, inexpensive and high bandwidth ethernet have be studied. IEEE802.1 Audio Video Bridging (AVB) is the standard used to transmit Audio and Video streaming data with guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). AVB can reserve network resources using IEEE 802.1 Qat protocol with low latency and periodic messages using traffic shaping. In addition, it can transmit streaming data with Credit based Shaping (CBS) algorithms. In this paper, we analyzed CBS algorithms. In addition, we measured the worst case in embedded system. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The pervasiveness of network softwarization has drawn keen interest from industrial domain as network convergence becomes increasingly desirable amongst industrial operators. Coupled with the concept of network slicing, operators will be able to tailor resources to applications regardless of the contrast in application requirements. However, while the concept of slicing is prevalent in industrial network circles, the realization of the concept in practical deployment scenarios is rarely emphasized. This paper provides a step-by-step analysis for the creation of dynamic network slices to guarantee real-time deterministic requirements of periodic industrial applications. The objective of the paper is achieved by the design and integration of worst-case delay models in the virtual network embedding problem with a focus on the behavior of time-sensitive forwarding mechanisms introduced in standard Ethernet bridges. The result shows that the approach is able to guarantee delay requirements irrespective of the arrival order of slices.

AB  - Deterministic and low end-to-end latency communication is an urgent demand for many safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles and automated industries. The time-sensitive network (TSN) is introduced as Ethernet-based amendments in IEEE 802.1 TSN standards to support time-triggered (TT) traffic in these applications. In the presence of TT flows, TSN is designed to integrate Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) and Best Effort (BE) traffic types. Although AVB traffic has a lower priority than TT, it still requires low and deterministic latency performance, which may not be guaranteed under strict predefined TT scheduling constraints. For this reason, a window-overlapping scheduling algorithm is recently proposed in different works as analytical forms for TT latency under overlapping-windows based. But worst-case AVB latency evaluation under overlapped TT windows is also essential for critical optimizations and tradeoffs. In this paper, a worst-case end-to-end delay (WCD) for AVB traffic under overlapping-based TT windows (AVB-OBTTW) algorithm is proposed. Separate analytical models are derived using the network calculus (NC) approach for AVB-OBTTW with both non-preemption and preemption mechanisms. Using an actual vehicular use case, the proposed models are evaluated with back-to-back and porosity configurations under light and heavy loading scenarios. For specific AVB credit bounds, a clear WCD reduction has been achieved by increasing the overlapping ratio (OR), especially under back-to-back configuration. Preemption and non-preemption modes are compared under different loading conditions, resulting in lower WCDs using preemption mode than non-preemption, especially with porosity style. Compared to the latest related works, AVB-OBTTW reduces WCD bounds and increases unscheduled bandwidth, leading to the highest enhancements with the maximum allowable OR.

AB  - Distributed safety-critical applications in industrial automation, aerospace, and automotive, require worst-case end-to-end latency analysis for critical communication flows in order to prove their correct behavior in the temporal domain. With the advent of time sensitive networks (TSNs), distributed applications can be built on top of standard Ethernet technologies without sacrificing real-time characteristics. The time-based transmission selection and clock synchronization mechanism defined in the TSN enable the real-time transmission of frames based on a global schedule configured through so-called gate control lists (GCLs). This paper has an enhancement of allowing a mixture of the priority-based scheduling and time-triggered, which expand the solution space for the GCLs. Then, it is necessary to analyze the latency bounds for the critical traffic in the TSN network. In this paper, we start from the assumption that the GCLs, i.e., the communication schedules, and the traffic class (priority) assignment for critical flows are given for each output port and derive, using network calculus, an analysis of the worst-case delays that individual critical flows can experience along the hops from sender to receiver(s). Our method can be employed for the analysis of the TSNs where the GCLs have been created in advance, as well as for driving the GCL synthesis that explores a larger solution space than previous methods, which required a complete isolation of transmission events from different traffic classes. We validate our model and analysis by performing experiments on both synthetic and real-world use-cases, showing the scalability of our implementation as well as the impact of certain GCL properties (gate overlapping and traffic class assignments) on the worst-case latency of critical communication flows.

AB  - A credit-based shaper (CBS) is adopted to guarantee the timing requirements of stream reservation (SR) class traffic in an Ethernet-audio video bridging (AVB) network, which introduces additional delay for best-effort (BE) traffic. This paper proposes an approach for calculating the worst-case response time (WCRT) of BE traffic and guaranteeing tightness; Moreover, a longest busy interval in which there exits an alternation of pending loads in SR class A and class B traffic at an output port, is defined and identified. Some suggestions for CBS parameters setting can be got form the results.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of worst-case timing analysis of extended Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) networks, incorporating Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) shapers called Burst Limiting Shapers (BLS), to enable the interconnection of different avionics domains with mixed-criticality levels, e.g., current AFDX traffic, Flight Control and In-Flight Entertainment. Conducting such an analysis is a challenging issue when considering multiple BLS-shaped traffic classes, due to the sophisticated inter-dependencies between the different shapers sharing the same output capacity. We tackle this problem through extending the applicability domain of our previous work for computing maximum delay bounds using Network Calculus and considering only one BLS class, called Continuous Credit-based Approach (CCbA), to handle multiple TSN/BLS classes. We provide further insights into the sensitivity and tightness issues of worst-case delay bounds yielded with the Generalized CCbA (GCCbA). Our assessments show that the tightness ratio is up to 85%, with reference to Achievable Worst-Case delays. We also show the improvements against recent state-of-the-art approaches in terms of tightness and complexity, where the computation time is up to 105 faster. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of GCCbA for realistic avionics case studies, e.g., adding A350 flight control traffic to the AFDX. Results show the good applicability of GCCbA and confirm the efficiency of the extended AFDX, which decreases the delay bounds of the existing AFDX traffic by up to 49.9%, in comparison with the current AFDX standard.

AB  - The demands for deterministic network services are getting significant. IEEE Time sensitive networking (TSN) task group has aimed for deterministic services through IEEE 802 networks. TSN's solutions rely on the time-synchronization and the slot scheduling coordinated throughout a network. The former requires costly hardware implementations for accuracy and scalability. The latter requires a schedulability analysis, which is proven to be NP-complete and not scalable. For modest-to-large scale dynamic networks, a more flexible solution is necessary. We propose a scalable framework that guarantees any desired jitter upper bound, including zero jitter. The framework is composed of; packets with relative time-stamps, a network that guarantees latency bounds, and buffers at the network egress. The latency bounds of a network can be of any value. The buffer holds packets for predetermined intervals to reproduce arbitrary inter-arrival intervals to inter-departure intervals, based on the network's latency bound. The idea behind the proposed framework is to minimize the latency first with work-conserving schedulers, and then adjust the jitter at the egress of a network. We argue that this is simpler than minimizing latency and jitter at the same time. A direct benefit of such simplicity is its scalability. We examine the network solutions that guarantee latency bound, such as the DiffServ and the Flow aggregate-interleave regulator (FAIR), as the candidates for the component in the framework. We show with a case study and simulations that the proposed framework can guarantee smaller latency bounds, with zero jitter, than those of the TSN's synchronous approach.
