AB  - Industrial automation networks are composed of cyber-physical systems where frame delays and jitter influence significantly the quality of communication between control and field devices. Due to these constraints, such systems are often served by dedicated Fieldbus networks which are different from networks for enterprise-level connectivity. However, with the introduction of Time-sensitive Networking standards which are already integrated into IEEE 802.1Q-2018 standards in essential parts, the long expected single converged network for any-type communication in the field, control, and enterprise level is within reach. With it, comes the challenge of synthesizing schedules to obtain parameters for configuring the network bridges for time-triggered communication services.This paper provides a scheduling verification, and Gate Control event computation algorithm focused on asserting the viability of scheduling communication services for multiple independent periodic Talker applications on IEEE 802.1Q- Time Sensitive Networks as well as the computation of Gate Control Lists for the bridges.

AB  - This paper proposes an approach to model switched Ethernet communication within a model- and component-based software development framework for vehicular distributed embedded systems. The paper also presents a method to extract the network timing model from the systems that use switched Ethernet networks. In order to provide a proof of concept, an existing industrial component model and its tool suite, namely RCM and Rubus-ICE respectively, are extended by implementing the modeling technique, the timing model extraction method and response-time analysis of the Ethernet AVB protocol. The extensions to RCM are backward compatible with the modeling and end-to-end timing analysis of traditional in-vehicle networks and legacy (previously developed) vehicular distributed embedded systems. Furthermore, the paper discusses the implementation and test strategy used in this work. Finally, the usability of the modeling approach and implemented timing analysis is demonstrated by modeling and time analyzing a vehicular application case study with the extended component model and tool suite.

AB  - Distributed embedded systems for safety-critical applications demand reliable communication with real-time characteristics. Switched Ethernet-based network is a practical and scalable solution that allows high-reliability level through path redundancy. The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standard is being developed to support real-time communication which supports a deterministic and low latency communication for safety-critical control applications, namely, Time-Triggered (TT) traffic class. In addition, a bounded-latency traffic class, namely, Audio Video Bridging (AVB) class is introduced. In this paper, we propose a multipath routing technique which tackles both TT and AVB traffic simultaneously. The proposed approach investigates satisfying path redundancy requirements for each message while the imposed interference from TT traffic on AVB traffic is minimized. The considered routing problem is formalized as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization problem. The Worst Case end-to-end Delay (WCD) is the optimization objective. 50 test cases of various network size and number of messages are solved to evaluate the performance, i.e., interference reduction, and the scalability of the proposed technique. Results demonstrate WCD reduction up to 90% comparing to the typical routing approach that determines TT and AVB routing in separate steps.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN) enhance standard IEEE 802.1Q Ethernet devices with real-time and time-aware capabilities. The forwarding of time-critical frames is done according to a so-called Gate Control List (GCL) schedule via the timed-gate mechanism introduced in IEEE 802.1Qbv. Most TSN scheduling mechanisms impose that all devices in the network must have the TSN capabilities related to scheduled gates and time synchronization. However, this is often an unrealistic assumption since many distributed applications use heterogeneous TSN networks with legacy or off-the-shelf end systems that are unscheduled and/or unsynchronized.This paper proposes a novel, more flexible TSN scheduling algorithm that intertwines a worst-case delay analysis within the scheduling synthesis step. Through this, we leverage the solution's optimality to support heterogeneous TSN networks featuring unscheduled and/or unsynchronized end-systems while still guaranteeing the timeliness of critical communication. We evaluate the performance of our approach using both synthetic and real-world use cases, comparing it with existing TSN scheduling mechanisms. Furthermore, we use OMNET++ to validate the generated GCL schedules.

AB  - Audio Video Bridging Ethernet (AVB) [1] is a standard developed by IEEE Audio Video Bridging Task Group based on switched-Ethernet. It is used in the automotive domain. AVB includes flow differentiation service using Fixed Priority (FP) policy. It ensures a class level credit based shaping (CBS) for high priority flows in each switch.A guaranteed upper bound on End-to-end (ETE) delays, in such a network, is mandatory for certification purpose. Some methods such as Compositional Performance Analysis (CPA) or Trajectory Approach (TA) have been designed to determine worst-case ETE delays in AVB networks. The Forward end-to-end delay Analysis (FA) has been initially developed for AFDX network for a First In First Out (FIFO) or FP/FIFO scheduling. In this paper, we extend it to take into account the CBS algorithm to cover also AVB networks. Finally, we apply FA on a sample configuration and compare the results to the aforementioned approach CPA.

AB  - Controller Area Network (CAN) and Ethernet network are expected to co-exist in automotive industry as Ethernet provides a high-bandwidth communication, while CAN is a legacy cost-effective solution. Due to the shortcomings of conventional switched Etherent, such as determinism, IEEE Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group developed a set of standards to enhance the switched Ethernet technology providing low-jitter and deterministic communication. Considering these two network domains, we investigate various design approaches for a gateway that connects a CAN domain to a TSN domain. We present three gateway forwarding techniques and we develop end-to-end delay analysis methods for them. Via the analysis methods and applying them to synthetic use cases we show that the intuitive existing approach of encapsulating multiple CAN frames into a single Ethernet frame is not necessarily an efficient solution. In fact, we demonstrate several cases where it is preferable to encapsulate only one CAN frame into a TSN frame, in particular when we use a high speed TSN network. The results have a significant impact on developing such gateways as the implementation of the one-to-one frame encapsulation is considerably simpler than other complex gateway-forwarding techniques.

AB  - The Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) amendments and protocols add capabilities on top of standard 802.1 Ethernet for guaranteeing the timeliness of both (isochronous) scheduled traffic (ST) and shaped (audio-video) communication (AVB) in distributed applications. ST streams are guaranteed via an offline computed schedule controlling the time-aware gate mechanism of IEEE 802.1Qbv, while AVB real-time streams are shaped via a credit-based shaper (CBS) and scheduler with lower-priority than ST. Although the two traffic classes use different TSN mechanisms, they are interrelated as the ST traffic class schedule influences the latency of AVB traffic.In this paper, we propose a method for the integration of the ST schedule synthesis with an analysis for the AVB class featuring IEEE 802.1Qbu frame preemption under different configurations to reduce the interference between the two classes. We first present a new worst-case response-time (WCRT) analysis for the AVB traffic class in TSN networks with preemption, considering an arbitrary number of AVB queues and different configurations for the CBS credit behavior. Then, we integrate the creation of ST schedule tables with the schedulability analysis of AVB traffic using a heuristic algorithm featuring frame preemption and a novel routing mechanism aimed at maximizing AVB schedulability. Finally, we evaluate our approach using both real-world and synthetic use cases showing the efficiency both in terms of schedule creation runtime and in terms of increasing the schedulability of lower-priority AVB traffic.

AB  - Existing papers on worst-case response time analysis for individual classes in Ethernet AVB typically focus on classes under credit-based shaping (CBS). There also exist industrial applications that use the Best-Effort class BE for non-hard real-time traffic with a minimum quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, however. In this paper, we therefore present a conjecture for worst-case response time analysis for that class BE, stating that the existing analysis based on eligible intervals can be equally well applied to a single (highest-priority) stream without CBS, by simply assuming the remaining bandwidth to be available to that stream. The conjecture is illustrated using a figure.

AB  - Ethernet AVB is being actively considered by the automotive industry as a candidate for in-vehicle communication backbone. However, several questions pertaining to schedulability of hard realtime messages transmitted via such a switch remain unanswered. In this paper, we attempt to fill this void. We derive equations to perform worst-case response time analysis on Ethernet AVB switches by considering its credit-based shaping algorithm. Also, we propose several approaches to reduce the pessimism in the analysis to provide tighter bounds.

AB  - The existing worst-case response time (WCRT) analysis for individual priority classes under credit-based shaping (CBS) in Ethernet AVB based on so-called eligible intervals is both independent and tight. This WCRT analysis does not rely on any assumptions on interfering inter-priority streams other than those enforced by the Ethernet standard. A major advantage of this independent analysis is that CBS may be viewed as resource reservation, where allocated bandwidth is both guaranteed and enforced. Although independent analysis provides inter-priority class robustness, it comes at a cost of over-provisioning bandwidth. We illustrate this cost of inter-priority class robustness by means of an example that requires 7.8 times the amount of bandwidth reservation for a given set of streams compared to a different analysis that takes knowledge of interpriority streams into account.

AB  - In the high-tech and automotive industry, bandwidth considerations and widely accepted standardization are two important reasons why Ethernet is currently being considered as an alternative solution for real-time communication (compared to the traditional fieldbusses). Although Ethernet was originally not intended for this purpose, the development of the Ethernet AVB standard enables its use for transporting high-volume data (e.g. from cameras and entertainment applications) with latency guarantees.The traditional busy-period analysis that ensures these latency guarantees relies on knowledge of all data streams, including interference. However, for complex industrial systems, the assumption that characteristics of all interfering data streams are known, is not realistic. As the amount of components connected to an Ethernet network grows, it becomes less likely that one can know or enforce the traffic patterns generated by all these components.In this paper, we present an independent real-time analysis based on so-called eligible intervals, which does not rely on any assumptions on interfering priority classes other than those enforced in the Ethernet AVB standard. We prove our analysis is tight when no additional information on interference is known. Furthermore, we compare the results of our approach to the two most recent busy-period analyses, point out sources of pessimism in these earlier works, and discuss the advantages of using eligible-intervals over busy-period analysis when studying idling servers.

AB  - Busy period analysis is often used as a basis for worst-case response time analysis of priority based systems. However, when shaping strategies are used to prevent starvation of lower priorities, it becomes difficult to achieve tightness results using this method. The reason for this is that a busy period is defined as the longest interval in which there exists pending load. It is exclusively based on execution time, and does not take the amount of provided bandwidth into account. As a consequence, it is less suitable for the study of idling systems. In particular, we do not yet have tightness results regarding the analysis of the Ethernet AVB standard, in which credit-based shaping is applied. In this paper, we propose an alternative to the use of busy periods. We show that, by defining an eligible interval in such a way that provisioning is taken into account, tight worst-case response time bounds can more easily be obtained for Ethernet AVB, at least in the case of either lower- or higher-priority interference.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a set of standardised communication protocols developed under the IEEE 802.1 working group. TSN aims to support deterministic communication based on network schedules that are distributively configured. It is widely considered as the future in-vehicle network solution for highly automated driving, where the requirement on timing guarantee is alongside the demand of high communication bandwidth. In this work, we study a setting of periodic control and non-control packets, with implicit and arbitrary deadlines, respectively. As the FIFO (first-in, first-out) queues in the 802.1Qbv switch incur long delay in the worst case, which prevents the control tasks from achieving short sampling periods and thus impedes control performance optimisation, we propose the first fixed-priority scheduling (FPS) approach for TSN by leveraging its gate control features. In this context, we develop a finer-grained frame-level response time analysis, which provides a tighter bound than the conventional packet-level analysis. Building upon FPS and the above analysis, we formulate a co-design optimisation problem to decide the sampling periods and poles of real-time controllers with settling time as the objective to minimise, whilst satisfying the schedulability constraint.

AB  - Industrial automation is changing towards a flat and highly interconnected architecture, with requirements for end-to-end real-time enabled machine-to-machine communications. Technologies such as time-sensitive networking (TSN) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) publish-subscribe provide the necessary features. While TSN is well explored, OPC UA's execution time behavior remains unknown. This article presents findings made while extending the open62541 OPC UA PubSub stack with the 802.1q VLAN tag to enable IEEE 802.1Qbv time-aware scheduling. The results include end-to-end timing measures and worst-case execution time analyses considering various payloads. Time-predictable T-CREST platforms host the publisher and subscriber, and a TSN network handles message transmission. The paper concludes by outlining further research focusing on dynamic memory access, buffer management, and the inclusion of non-priority access to the Ethernet port.

AB  - Worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis is a prevalent way to ensure the timely execution of programs in time-critical systems. With the advent of new technologies such as fog computing and time-sensitive networking (TSN), the interest in timing analysis has increased in industrial communication. This paper highlights experiences made while adjusting the publisher of the open62541 OPC UA stack to enable WCET analysis, following a simple process combined with the open-source platform T-CREST. The main challenges are the required knowledge about the code and the specific communication software characteristics like variable message sizes. Other findings indicate the need for other types of annotation for indirect recursion or callback functions. The paper provides the foundation for further research on adjusting the implementation of existing industrial communication protocols for WCET analysis.

AB  - IEC 61850 has become the reference standard for Substation Automation Systems (SAS) in smart power grids. Current IEC 61850 compliant SAS use Ethernet technology for both Event-Triggered (ET) and Time-Triggered (TT) traffic to transport highly critical messages requiring low-latency guarantees. However the real-time guarantee is often achieved by over-provisioning network resources. In this paper we study the potentials of using Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) in SAS. TSN adds real-time enhancement to the existing IEEE 802.1Q standard by providing several new traffic shapers. If TT traffic can be guaranteed by scheduling its transmission at the right time using TSN time-aware shaper, it is not the case for ET traffic. The paper contribution is twofold: proposing a first mapping of the IEC 61850 protocols to the TSN traffic classes, based on the analysis of both TSN and IEC 61850 protocols; and developing an exact worst-case delay (WCD) analysis for ET traffic. The tightness of the developed WCD analysis has be shown by simulations.

AB  - Schedulability analysis is one of the most important issues in developing and analyzing real-time systems. Given a task system where each task is characterized by a worst-case execution time (WCET) and a relative deadline, the schedulability analysis is decidable. However in reality, it is difficult to calculate the WCET of a complex task, even after it is abstracted to a formal model, e.g., timed automata (TAs). This paper proposes a schedulability analysis method without the information of the WCET, by introducing a model named timed regular task automata (TRTAs). Each task is described by a TA, a starting point with a clock valuation, a status and a relative deadline. A test is performed on each TA for an under-approximation of the WCET. The system may still be unschedulable under the approximation. A further schedulability checking is then performed by encoding to the reachability problem of nested timed automata (NeTAs). The methodology is thus sound and complete.

AB  - In this paper, we model and analyse the timing performance of an extended AFDX standard, incorporating the Burst Limiting Shaper (BLS) proposed by the Time Sensitive Networking group. The extended AFDX will enable the interconnection of different avionics domains with mixed-criticality levels, e.g., current AFDX traffic, Flight Control and In-Flight Entertainment. First, we present the model and the worst-case timing analysis, using the Network Calculus framework, of such an extended AFDX to infer real-time guarantees. Secondly, we conduct its performance evaluation on a representative AFDX configuration. Results show the tightness of the proposed model, with reference to simulation results. Moreover, they confirm the efficiency of incorporating the BLS in the AFDX standard to noticeably enhance the medium priority level delay bounds, while respecting the higher priority level constraints, in comparison with the current AFDX standard.

AB  - A homogeneous avionic communication architecture based on the AFDX supporting mixed-criticality applications will bring significant advantages, i.e., easier maintenance and reduced costs. To cope with this emerging issue, the AFDX may integrate multiple traffic classes: Safety-Critical Traffic (SCT) with hard real-time constraints, Rate-Constrained (RC) traffic requiring bounded latencies and Best Effort (BE) traffic with no delivery constraints. These traffic classes are managed based on a Non-Preemptive Strict Priority (NP-SP) Scheduler, where the highest priority traffic (SCT) is shaped with a Burst Limiting Shaper (BLS). The latter has been defined by the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group to limit the impact of high priority flows on lower priority ones. This paper proposes a Network Calculus-based approach to compute the end-to-end delay bounds of SCT and RC classes. We consider the impact of the BLS and the multi-hop network architecture. We also provide proofs of service curves guaranteed to SCT and RC classes, needed to derive delay bounds with Network Calculus. The proposed approach is evaluated on a realistic AFDX configuration. Results show the efficiency of incorporating the TSN/BLS on top of a NP-SP scheduler in the AFDX to noticeably enhance the RC delay bounds while guaranteeing the SCT deadline, in comparison to an AFDX implementing only a NP-SP scheduler.

AB  - Most of the recent researches related to hybrid traffic scheduling in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) focus on how to ensure bounded low-delay transmission for Scheduled Traffic (ST) and Stream Reservation (SR) traffic. However, if high-priority traffic blocks Best Effort (BE) traffic represented by data logging and periodic software updates for a long time, the end-to-end delay of BE messages will be too large. To reduce the blocking of SR traffic on BE traffic by reducing the reserved bandwidth for SR traffic, this paper proposes a traffic scheduling algorithm combined with ingress shaping. First, add ingress buffers before SR queues. Then, schedule SR traffic on a per-flow basis in the TSN switch by limiting the rate at which frames in each ingress buffer enter the SR queue. Finally, joint egress shaping and ingress shaping to reserve bandwidth resources that match its delay requirement for each SR flow. Simulation results show that the maximum end-to-end delay of BE messages can be reduced by 0.32%similar to 17.19%.

AB  - Flow control is of particular importance in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), where timeliness of messages is guaranteed through several types of traffic shaping. This has given rise to a number of papers discussing the worst-case response time analysis of, in particular, the credit-based traffic shaping approach. In this work-in-progress paper, we concern ourselves with the possibility that traffic shaping can be applied in different layers of the protocol stack, e.g. the physical layer and link layer, which may give rise to different credit behaviors. We convey our concern that the analysis performed in literature seems to assume application of traffic shaping in the physical layer, and that the analysis therefore cannot be readily used in a context where shaping is applied in a higher layer. In particular, assuming application of credit-based shaping in the link layer, there are different interpretations possible for credit behavior. Depending on the interpretation, some of the basic properties of credit, that are crucial for the analysis, may no longer be valid after overhead is added by the physical layer. As an ongoing effort, we plan to revisit the eligible interval analysis of [1] with an adaptation for a link layer interpretation of the standard concerning application of traffic shaping.

AB  - This paper presents a schedulability analysis for the Best-Effort (BE) traffic class within Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) networks. The presented analysis considers several features in the TSN standards, including the Credit-Based Shaper (CBS), the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) and the frame preemption. Although the BE class in TSN is primarily used for the traffic with no strict timing requirements, some industrial applications prefer to utilize this class for the non-hard real-time traffic instead of classes that use the CBS. The reason mainly lies in the fact that the complexity of TSN configuration becomes significantly high when the time-triggered traffic via the TAS and other classes via the CBS are used altogether. We demonstrate the applicability of the presented analysis on a vehicular application use case. We show that a network designer can get information on the schedulability of the BE traffic, based on which the network configuration can be further refined with respect to the application requirements.

AB  - The IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards' amendment 802.1Qbv provides real-time guarantees for Scheduled Traffic (ST) streams by the Time Aware Shaper (TAS) mechanism. In this paper, we develop offline schedule optimization objective functions to configure the TAS for ST streams, which can be effective to achieve a high Quality of Service (QoS) of lower priority Best-Effort (BE) traffic. This becomes useful if real-time streams from legacy protocols are configured to be carried by the BE class or if the BE class is used for value-added (but non-critical) services. We present three alternative objective functions, namely Maximization, Sparse and Evenly Sparse, followed by a set of constraints on ST streams. Based on simulated stream traces in OMNeT++/INET TSN NeSTiNg simulator, we compare our proposed schemes with a most commonly applied objective function in terms of overall maximum end-to-end delay and deadline misses of BE streams. The results confirm that changing the schedule synthesis objective to our proposed schemes ensures timely delivery and lower end-to-end delays in BE streams.

AB  - In this paper, we present an end-to-end timing model to capture timing information from software architectures of distributed embedded systems that use network communication based on the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards. Such a model is required as an input to perform end-to-end timing analysis of these systems. Furthermore, we present a methodology that aims at automated extraction of instances of the end-to-end timing model from component-based software architectures of the systems and the TSN network configurations. As a proof of concept, we implement the proposed end-to-end timing model and the extraction methodology in the Rubus Component Model (RCM) and its tool chain Rubus-ICE that are used in the vehicle industry. We demonstrate the usability of the proposed model and methodology by modeling a vehicular industrial use case and performing its timing analysis.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a promising solution for the next generation in-vehicle networks. To enable innovations in adaptability, there is a strong trend to integrate TSN with Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Software-defined TSN requires fast routing algorithms that guarantee the Worst-Case End-to-End Delay (WCED) of the Audio Video Bridging (AVB) flows. However, current AVB flow routing algorithms execute WCED analysis for an exponential amount of route candidates, which is not feasible at run-time. Current WCED analysis of the AVB flows depends on the specific flow setup of other traffic classes. When high-priority flows change, low-priority flows must be adjusted as well to maintain deadline guarantees. In this paper, we propose a per-class flow management scheme to enable run-time routing of the AVB flows. Our composable analysis computes a formal WCED bound of the AVB flows. It does not rely on the flow setup of other traffic classes. So, the WCED and routes can be computed for each traffic class independently and in parallel. Based on the analysis, we develop a fast heuristic algorithm to incrementally route the AVB flows with guaranteed deadlines. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to the existing solutions, the composable analysis is 2.6x faster. The cost is that the WCED bound can be up to 31% higher. When given a similar run-time as existing solutions, the proposed routing algorithm can set up 1.6x more flows. The average time to set up one flow is within 0.14s.

AB  - In the automotive domain, Ethernet Audio Video Bridging (AVB) provides service guarantees for real-time traffic. Its configuration synthesis requires routing the flows and allocating the bandwidth for Credit Based Shaping (CBS). Current approaches typically employ deadline-oblivious bandwidth allocation and rely on routing to establish deadline guarantees. But the worst-case delay of AVB flows requires complex analysis. Thus, routing integrated with the delay analysis either supports limited Stream Reservation (SR) classes or suffers significant timing overhead. To enable efficient run-time flow setup, we propose SynAVB, a tool to synthesize the configuration of Ethernet AVB, which establishes deadline awareness in bandwidth allocation. SynAVB supports an arbitrary number of SR classes and processes them one by one. For the flows in an SR class, it first performs a deadline-oblivious routing based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to guarantee the necessary bandwidth required by the flows. Then, a deadline-aware slope allocation algorithm computes the bandwidth required on every link to satisfy the deadline of all flows. Our experiment demonstrates that, given the same routes, the deadline-aware bandwidth allocation results in fewer flows violating the deadline compared with other allocation strategies. Moreover, SynAVB can guarantee the deadline of more flows while its run-time is up to 14.3x faster than the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB  - In this work, we ask if Machine Learning (ML) can provide a viable alternative to conventional schedulability analysis to determine whether a real-time Ethernet network meets a set of timing constraints. Otherwise said, can an algorithm learn what makes it difficult for a system to be feasible and predict whether a configuration will be feasible without executing a schedulability analysis? To get insights into this question, we apply a standard supervised ML technique, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and compare its accuracy and running times against precise and approximate schedulability analyses developed in Network-Calculus. The experiments consider different TSN scheduling solutions based on priority levels combined for one of them with traffic shaping. The results obtained on an automotive network topology suggest that k-NN is efficient at predicting the feasibility of realistic TSN networks, with an accuracy ranging from 91.8% to 95.9% depending on the exact TSN scheduling mechanism and a speedup of 190 over schedulability analysis for 10(6) configurations. Unlike schedulability analysis, ML leads however to a certain rate "false positives" (i.e., configurations deemed feasible while they are not). Nonetheless ML-based feasibility assessment techniques offer new trade-offs between accuracy and computation time that are especially interesting in contexts such as design-space exploration where false positives can be tolerated during the exploration process.

AB  - Machine learning (ML), and supervised learning in particular, can be used to learn what makes it hard for a network to be feasible and try to predict whether a network configuration will be feasible without executing a conventional schedulability analysis. A disadvantage of ML-based timing verification with respect to schedulability analysis is the possibility of "false positives": configurations deemed feasible while they are not. In this work, in order to minimize the rate of false positives, we propose the use of a measure of the uncertainty of the prediction to drop it when the uncertainty is too high, and rely instead on schedulability analysis. In this hybrid verification strategy, the clear-cut decisions are taken by ML, while the more difficult ones are taken by a conventional schedulability analysis. Importantly, the trade-off achieved between prediction accuracy and computing time can be controlled. We apply this hybrid verification method to Ethernet TSN networks and obtain, for instance in the case of priority scheduling with 8 traffic classes, a 99% prediction accuracy with a speedup factor of 5.7 with respect to conventional schedulability analysis and a reduction of 46% of the false positives compared to ML alone.

AB  - Future autonomous vehicles and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) need real-time audio and video transmission together with control data traffic (CDT). Audio/video stream delay analysis has been largely investigated in AVB (Audio Video Bridging) context, but not yet with the presence of the CDT in the new TSN context. In this paper we present a local delay analysis of AVB frames under hierarchical scheduling of credit-based shaping and time-aware shaping on TSN switches. We present the effects of time aware shaping on AVB traffic, how it changes the relative order of transmission of frames leading to bursts and worst case scenarios for lower priority streams. We also show that these bursts are upper-bounded by the Credit-Bases Shaper, hence the worst-case transmissions delay of a given stream is also upper-bounded. We present the analysis to compute the worst case delay for a frame, as well as the feasibility condition necessary for the analysis to be applied. Our methods (analysis and simulation) are applied to an automotive use case, which is defined within the Eurostars RETINA project, and where both control data traffic and AVB traffic must be guaranteed.

AB  - In this paper we discuss the challenges that are faced when the state-of-the-art research results are transferred to a model-based tool chain for the industrial use. These challenges are often overlooked when the research results are implemented in an academic environment. In particular, we discuss various challenges regarding the implementation and integration of the response-time analysis for heterogeneous networks, comprising of CAN and Ethernet AVB, as a plug-in for the Rubus Analysis Framework. Rubus tool suite is used for the model- and component-based development of software for vehicular real-time systems by several international companies. We also discuss preliminary solutions to deal with the challenges.

AB  - This paper presents the first holistic modeling approach for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) communication that integrates into a model- and component-based software development framework for distributed embedded systems. Based on these new models, we also present an end-to-end timing model for TSN-interconnected distributed embedded systems. Our approach is expressive enough to model the timing information of TSN and the timing behaviour of software that communicates over TSN, hence allowing end-to-end timing analysis. A proof of concept for the proposed approach is provided by implementing it for a component model and tool suite used in the vehicle industry. Moreover, a use case from the vehicle industry is modeled and analyzed with the proposed approach to demonstrate its usability.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is becoming more important in automotive and industrial sectors. There is no clear strategy how to use TSN to improve and migrate the established real-time protocols without excluding legacy devices. This paper presents a realistic concept to integrate TSN into automation networks. We choose Sercos as a deterministic Industrial-Ethernet protocol to be extended with the TSN Standards IEEE 802.1AS-Rev and IEEE 802.1Qbv. By simulating the Sercos over TSN network, we investigate the impact of integrating a TSN-capable switch in a Sercos network to enable a topology extension from line/ring to star/tree. By comparing the impact of: increasing the data rate and topology extension, we demonstrate the improvement of Industrial-Ethernet timing performance.

AB  - Ethernet is nowadays a promising communication technology for automotive applications as, comparing with the existing in-vehicle networks, it offers high bandwidth and a significant reduction of cabling costs, while meeting the EMC/EMI requirements of automotive communications. The IEEE 802.1Q standard is one of the base standards of Time-Sensitive Networking. It offers several benefits, such as the real-time support, as it provides bounded latency to time-constrained traffic classes, with zero jitter and congestion-free transmissions, and the capability to handle multiple traffic classes on the same channel. The IEEE 802.1Q standard specifies multiple features, that support different ways to handle the transmission of Ethernet frames. In this paper a comparative performance assessment of three network configurations defined in the IEEE 802.1Q standard for automotive applications are presented. The assessment results are obtained using the OMNeT++ framework. The comparison between the results of these three different network configurations, using realistic traffic patterns, provides a quantitative evaluation of the network performance in terms of maximum end-to-end delays and absolute jitter.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) introduces standardized mechanisms that add real-time capabilities to IEEE 802.1 Ethernet networks. In particular, the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) can be used to send frames in a deterministic fashion according to a predefined global schedule. Existing methods for generating the global communication schedule enforce isolation either in the time or in the space domain. This extended abstract presents a novel, more flexible window-based scheduling algorithm which removes the previously required isolation constraints for Scheduled Traffic (ST) by integrating worst-case delay analysis to guarantee bounded latency.

AB  - In the automotive industry, Ethernet is currently being introduced as a viable solution for real-time communication with high bandwidth requirements. In this paper, we present and prove a tight bound for the relative best-case response time of a frame in an Ethernet AVB switch compared to its response time in a schedule without interference. Our analysis is based on the observation that frames in a burst, scheduled using a credit shaping policy, may be scheduled earlier in case of interference than in a schedule without interference. We show how an upper bound on the build up of credit may be used to bound this relative speed-up of frames.

AB  - Network technologies are being developed to increase not only performance of data communication but also for provision of deterministic guarantees. Such designs foster the development of distributed real-time applications. When networks must provide time-sensitive communication, a commonly found design feature is First-In First-Out (FIFO) - a natural design for multiplexing different data flows into queues and for scheduling queued data. Alongside technological advancements, there is the development of formal tools to reason about timing behavior. Network Calculus is such a methodology. It has been widely adopted already and its modeling capabilities were extended to features found in modern standards as, e.g., in IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking. However, the basic challenge to compute a deterministic bound on a flow's worst-case end-to-end delay in FIFO networks still imposes challenges. Different analyses exist but often offer limited scalability. In this paper, we present an analysis with a readily tunable tradeoff between quality of the delay bound and the computational effort it imposes. We combine a greedy algorithm with an iterative directed search whose termination criterion can be adapted, e.g., subject to the analyzed network size. Our approach provides bounds of competitive quality at smaller computational cost than current alternatives for the analysis of feedforward FIFO networks.

AB  - Many Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications have zero fault tolerance. Redundant networks are hence an important prerequisite for a dependable infrastructure to serve the various data traffic classes required for such applications. In this paper, we perform a delay analysis of a Quality Checks After Production (QCAP) application, which is running on a Time-Sensitive Network (TSN). We evaluate the worst-case delay of all data flows traversing the redundant TSN network using a Network Calculus (NC) based framework. We also evaluate how network parameters and configurations affect the QCAP application's service requirements.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) extends traditional Ethernet to support data traffic with ultra-reliability and time-critical requirements for a range of applications in industrial automation, automotive, and aerospace. The TSN standards present guidelines to integrate different types of data traffic over a single converged network. Therefore, it is becoming an enabling technology towards the Industry 4.0 vision of integrating information and operational technologies within future Industrial Internet of Things networks. In this paper, we develop a network calculus based framework to analyse TSN based industrial networks supporting a range of data traffic classes. We apply the framework to study and analyse a well-known industrial use case, Quality Checks After Production (QCAP), with four data traffic types with different requirements in terms of reliability and end-to-end latency. In our evaluation, we validate our framework with a computer simulation model and compare the tightness of the calculated delay bounds to a state-of-the-art approach. We then use our model to analyse the upper bounds on the worst-case delay of the different QCAP traffic types and assess the factors that impact end-to-end delay, e.g. flow offset and critical links. Finally, we compare various credit accumulation rates and their impact on the traffic delay bounds.

AB  - To cope with requirements for low latency, the upcoming Ethernet standard Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) provides enhancements for scheduled traffic, enabling mixed-criticality networks where critical messages are sent according to a system-wide schedule. While these networks provide a completely predictable behavior of the scheduled traffic by construction, timing analysis of the critical non-scheduled traffic with hard deadlines remains an unsolved issue. State-of-the-art analysis approaches consider the interference that unscheduled messages impose on each other, but there is currently no approach to determine the worst-case interference that can be imposed by scheduled traffic, the so-called schedule interference (SI), without relying on restrictions of the shape of the schedule. Considering all possible interference scenarios during each calculation of the SI is impractical, as it results in an explosion of the computation time. As a remedy, this paper proposes a) an approach to integrate the analysis of the worst-case SI into state-of-the-art timing analysis approaches and b) preprocessing techniques that reduce the computation time of the SI-calculation by several orders of magnitude without introducing any pessimism.

AB  - Real-time switched Ethernet communication is of increasing importance in many cyber-physical and embedded systems application areas such as automotive electronics, avionics, and industrial control. The IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group develops standards for real-time Ethernet, for example a time-triggered traffic class (IEEE 802.1Qbv-2015). New application areas, such as active safety and autonomous driving using radar, lidar, and camera sensors, which do not fall into the strictly periodic, time-triggered communication model, require a flexible traffic class that can accommodate various communication models while still providing hard real-time guarantees. In our previous work, we developed such a traffic class, Urgency-Based Scheduler (UBS), and its worst-case latency analysis. UBS is currently under standardization (P802.1Qcr) in the TSN task group. In this paper, we introduce and solve the UBS synthesis problem of assigning hard real-time data flows to queues and priority levels to queues, the main parameters that determine communication latencies. The synthesis problem is particularly challenging due to the flexibility offered by UBS to aggregate flows and assign individual priority levels per network hop. We present an SMT approach, a cluster-based heuristic, and an extensive experimental evaluation.

AB  - Switched Ethernet has been proposed as network technology for automotive and industrial applications. IEEE AVB is a collection of standards that specifies (among other elements) a set of network traffic shaping mechanisms (i.e., rules to regulate the traffic flow) to have guaranteed Quality of Service for Audio/Video traffic. However, in-vehicle control applications like advanced driver-assistance systems require much lower latencies than provided by this standard. Within the context of IEEE TSN (Time Sensitive Networking), three new traffic shaping mechanisms are considered, named Burst Limiting, Time Aware and Peristaltic shaper respectively. In this paper we explain and compare these shapers, we examine their worst case end-to-end latencies analytically and we investigate their behavior through a simulation of a particular setup. We show that the shapers hardly satisfy the requirements for 100Mbps Ethernet, but can come close under further restrictions. We also show the impact the shapers have on AVB traffic.

AB  - Ethernet is considered as a future communication standard for distributed embedded systems in the automotive and industrial domains. A key challenge is the deterministic low-latency transport of Ethernet frames, as many safety-critical real-time applications in these domains have tight timing requirements. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an upcoming set of Ethernet standards, which (among other things) address these requirements by specifying new quality of service mechanisms in the form of different traffic shapers. In this paper, we consider TSN's time-aware and peristaltic shapers and evaluate whether these shapers are able to fulfill these strict timing requirements. We present a formal timing analysis, which is a key requirement for the adoption of Ethernet in safety-critical real-time systems, to derive worst-case latency bounds for each shaper. We use a realistic automotive Ethernet setup to compare these shapers to each other and against Ethernet following IEEE 802.1Q.

Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an upcoming set of Ethernet standards, which address these requirements by specifying new quality of service mechanisms in the form of different traffic shapers. One of these traffic shapers is the burst-limiting shaper (BLS). In this paper, we evaluate whether BLS is able to fulfill these strict timing requirements.

AB  - One of the key challenges in future Ethernet-based automotive and industrial networks is the low-latency transport of time-critical data. To date, Ethernet frames are sent non-preemptively. This introduces a major source of delay, as, in the worst-case, a latency-critical frame might be blocked by a frame of lower priority, which started transmission just before the latency-critical frame. The upcoming IEEE 802.3br standard will introduce Ethernet frame preemption to address this problem. While high-priority traffic benefits from preemption, lower-priority (yet still latency-sensitive) traffic experiences a certain overhead, impacting its timing behavior. In this paper, we present a formal timing analysis for Ethernet to derive worst-case latency bounds under preemption. We use a realistic automotive Ethernet setup to analyze the worst-case performance of standard Ethernet and Ethernet TSN under preemption and also compare our results to non-preemptive implementations of these standards.

AB  - Time-sensitive network (TSN) is regarded as the perspective communication network for the intelligent vehicle application because of its reserved bandwidths, QoS mechanisms, low transmission latency. The message scheduling in the TSN have an important influence on the reliability and safety of vehicles. In this paper, the TSN messages between the vehicular electronic control units are classified into the control data traffic (CDT), the stream reservation (SR) and the best effort (BE). A hierarchical scheduling infrastructure for the three types of messages are presented, which consists of three scheduling strategies, i.e., FIFO, CBS and TAS. For the hierarchical scheduling mechanism, the influences of both FIFO and TAS on CBS are analyzed and an approach for the derivation of worst-case response times of SR message is proposed. The experiments in Vector CANoe show that the proposed method in this paper can effectively obtain the upper bound of SR message transmission in TSN. It can be used to improve the design of TSN system.

AB  - Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet) is a time-critical network for industrial and avionics applications improved from the Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX). It is standardized by SAE AS6802 and satisfies strict timing transmission by use of a mixture infrastructure to support Time-Triggered (TT), Rate-Constraint (RC) and Best-Effort (BE) traffics. The key feature is a time-triggered communication paradigm according to off-line schedule table based on global synchronization. Three integration methods (preemption, timely block and shuffling) are used to resolve conflict when a TT message gets ready and a RC message is already in transmission. Besides several real-time Ethernet solutions, Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) shows great interests and attractions to satisfy the increasing and variable transmission requirements for automotive and aeronautical industry. TSN is comprised of several IEEE standards developed under IEEE 802.1 TSN Task Group, such as 802.1AS, 802.1Qav, 802.1Qat, 802.1BA, 802.1Qbv and 802.1Qbu. On top of SPQ (Static Priority Queuing) scheduling mechanism, with best effort traffics in parallel, TSN introduces guaranteed timing behavior with focus on the transportation for Control Data traffic (CDT) under Time Aware Shaper (TAS) and audio video streams under Credit-Based Shaper (CBS). This paper introduces the basic principles of TSN standard in details, compares it with the properties of the TTEthernet standard. In particular, we first investigate their clock synchronization algorithms and discuss their shaping and scheduling strategies for traffic types with individual timing requirements. Then we show the impact the hard real-time traffic has on soft real-time traffic and give the worst case end-to-end latency calculation. Finally, we determine whether TSN offers flexibility for the requirements of avionic.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a collection of standards that extend Ethernet to support safety-critical and real-time applications. TSN integrates multiple traffic types, i.e., Time-Triggered (TT) traffic scheduled based on Gate-Control-Lists (GCLs), Audio-Video-Bridging (AVB) traffic that requires bounded latencies, and Best-Effort (BE) traffic, for which no guarantees are provided. This paper proposes a Network Calculus-based approach to determine the worst-case end-to-end delays of AVB traffic in a TSN network with both non-preemption and preemption modes. We consider the effects of TT traffic due to GCLs, "guard bands", i.e., time windows that block other traffic from transmitting, and preemption overhead on the service for AVB traffic. We provide a proof of non-overflow condition for AVB credit, which is used to control the AVB traffic transmission. The analysis method is evaluated on realistic test cases, and compared to related work.

AB  - A homogeneous avionic communication architecture based on the AFDX supporting mixed-criticality applications will bring significant advantages, i.e., easier maintenance and reduced costs. To cope with this emerging issue, the AFDX may integrate multiple traffic classes: Safety-Critical Traffic (SCT) with hard real-time constraints, Rate-Constrained (RC) traffic requiring bounded latencies and Best Effort (BE) traffic with no delivery constraints. These traffic classes are managed based on a Non-Preemptive Strict Priority (NP-SP) Scheduler, where the highest priority traffic (SCT) is shaped with a Burst Limiting Shaper (BLS). The latter has been defined by the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group to limit the impact of high priority flows on lower priority ones. This paper proposes a Network Calculus-based approach to compute the end-to-end delay bounds of SCT and RC classes. We consider the impact of the BLS and the multi-hop network architecture. We also provide proofs of service curves guaranteed to SCT and RC classes, needed to derive delay bounds with Network Calculus. The proposed approach is evaluated on a realistic AFDX configuration. Results show the efficiency of incorporating the TSN/BLS on top of a NP-SP scheduler in the AFDX to noticeably enhance the RC delay bounds while guaranteeing the SCT deadline, in comparison to an AFDX implementing only a NP-SP scheduler.

AB  - Recent years witnessed a fast-growing demand, in the context of industrial use-cases, for the so-called Deterministic Networks (DetNet). IEEE 802.1 TSN architecture provides linklayer services and IETF DetNet provides network-layer services for deterministic and reliable forwarding. In such a context, in the first part of this paper, we tackle the problem of misbehaving flows and propose a novel queuing and scheduling mechanism, based on Push-In-First-Out (PIFO) queues. Differently from the original DetNet/TSN specifications, our solution is able to guarantee performance of priority flows in spite of misbehaving flows. In the second part of this paper, we present our simulator DeNS:DetNet Simulator, based on OMNET++ and NeSTiNG, providing building blocks for link-layer TSN and network-layer DetNet. Existing simulators have important limitations that do not allow simulating the full DetNeyTSN protocol stack. We overcome these limitations, making easy DetNet/TSN evaluations possible. Our simulations clearly show that our solution is able to satisfy constraints of deterministic networks, namely, guarantee zero packet loss and low latency, while at the same time allowing best-effort flows to co-exist. Furthermore, we show how our newly-proposed queuing and scheduling solution successfully limits the impact of misbehaving flows.

AB  - The IEEE 802.1 Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) protocol successfully supports audio/video streaming over Ethernet networks and is also a promising candidate for industrial automation. However, several industrial automation applications feature requirements that cannot be fulfilled by the current AVB standard. The next generation of IEEE 802.1 standards, which will specifically target the requirements of automotive and industrial control, is under specification within IEEE 802.1 Working Group. Inspired by such an ongoing work, this paper addresses the introduction in IEEE AVB networks of scheduled traffic, i.e., high priority traffic that is transmitted according to a time schedule so as to ensure no interference from other traffic classes. The paper describes the proposed approach, discusses the design choices and presents a performance assessment based on OMNeT++ simulations.

AB  - Industrial real-time applications demand their communication networks be robust and deterministic so that packets are delivered with bounded delay and jitter. The IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group has amended the standards of IEEE 802.3 Ethernet to support time-triggered flows of real-time applications. However, the issues of routing and scheduling are left as open problems. Specifically, majority of the state-of-the-art scheduling efforts make certain assumptions, such as assuming that the routing information is known \textit{a priori} to focus on the scheduling problem or assuming that the information of flows is known in advance. Other studies that avoided these assumptions ignore certain valuable information that could be taken advantage of to make better routing decisions, such as the residual bandwidth. In this paper, we first propose an incremental QoS-aware path selection algorithm that uses QoS measurement to route TSN flows. Then, we introduce multiple incremental scheduling algorithms that address above mentioned issues, and demonstrate their performance.

AB  - Increasing bandwidth requirements in vehicles are pushing the backbone architectures to use faster switching technologies like Ethernet. However, the traditional Ethernet cannot satisfy the strict latency requirements in a vehicle. As a solution, switched Ethernet variants like Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Audio Video Bridging (AVB) are being standardized for automotive Ethernet. Moreover, it is expected that the intravehicle backbone architectures will shift to a zonal architecture for more centralizing the processing and decreasing the costs. In this paper, we present the recent trends, advances and challenges in intra-vehicle backbone networks. Moreover, we compare a TSN+AVB Ethernet backbone architecture with an alternative cut-through switching optical backbone network architecture by simulation and show that the cut-through switching optical architecture may achieve lower latency.

AB  - For the past few decades, handling large amount of data in vehicle network, especially video streaming, has become a very important subject. It is crucial not only for a transmission management but also, for reducing a latency between devices. In this paper a novel design and optimization algorithm of in-vehicle networking technologies related Ethernet Audio Video Bridge (AVB) technology is proposed. A proposal of Low Latency of Ethernet Audio Video Bridge (LL-EAVB) plays a significant role in reducing the delay between components. The approach on realistic test cases showed that there was a delay reduction about 43%. The results achieved from the experiments on the latency present in each function are reliable because average values are obtained through repeated actual tests for several months. It is expected that the optimization method for the actual automotive environment can greatly shorten the time period in the design and development process. It will greatly benefit the industry since analyzing the latency between each function in a short period of time is very important.

AB  - Named Data Networking (NDN) has evolved as a networking model that can facilitate Internet of Things (IoT) applications by providing a name-based communication model, innetwork caching, and inherent support for data-centric security. However, despite the benefits, the best-effort NDN cannot offer the deterministic data delivery required by safety-critical IoT applications. This paper proposes a novel deadline-aware NDN protocol that utilizes a critical deadline first scheduler to prioritize traffic based on the approaching deadline. Evaluation results show that the proposed deadline-aware NDN can meet the communication needs of time-sensitive IoT applications.

AB  - Industrial automation networks are composed of cyber-physical systems where frame delays and jitter influence significantly the quality of communication between control and field devices. Due to these constraints, such systems are often served by dedicated Fieldbus networks which are different from networks for enterprise-level connectivity. However, with the introduction of Time-sensitive Networking standards which are already integrated into IEEE 802.1Q-2018 standards in essential parts, the long expected single converged network for any-type communication in the field, control, and enterprise level is within reach. With it, comes the challenge of synthesizing schedules to obtain parameters for configuring the network bridges for time-triggered communication services.This paper provides a scheduling verification, and Gate Control event computation algorithm focused on asserting the viability of scheduling communication services for multiple independent periodic Talker applications on IEEE 802.1Q- Time Sensitive Networks as well as the computation of Gate Control Lists for the bridges.

AB  - The pervasiveness of network softwarization has drawn keen interest from industrial domain as network convergence becomes increasingly desirable amongst industrial operators. Coupled with the concept of network slicing, operators will be able to tailor resources to applications regardless of the contrast in application requirements. However, while the concept of slicing is prevalent in industrial network circles, the realization of the concept in practical deployment scenarios is rarely emphasized. This paper provides a step-by-step analysis for the creation of dynamic network slices to guarantee real-time deterministic requirements of periodic industrial applications. The objective of the paper is achieved by the design and integration of worst-case delay models in the virtual network embedding problem with a focus on the behavior of time-sensitive forwarding mechanisms introduced in standard Ethernet bridges. The result shows that the approach is able to guarantee delay requirements irrespective of the arrival order of slices.

AB  - Proprietary field buses such as PROFINET IRT, EtherNet/IP, and EtherCAT are currently used to ensure realtime communication in industrial automation appliances. Despite the fact that they are mostly Ethernet-based, interoperability between them is limited or not feasible at all. In the Industry 4.0 context, the goal is to enable real-time communication with ultralow latencies, while also permitting non-critical traffic and ensuring interoperability between devices from different manufacturers. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a promising candidate to meet these requirements on layer 2 of the OSI reference model in conjunction with a suitable higher-level protocol. The IEEE 802.1 TSN Task Group has been developing extensions to the Ethernet technology to make it more deterministic and reliable since 2012. In this paper, we have evaluated the TSN mechanisms (1) Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) and (2) frame preemption (FP) and compared them to the existing strict priority scheduling (ST) mechanism in exemplary setups. The chosen comparison criteria are latency guarantee, jitter, and the influence on non-critical traffic. Since the support of TSN devices on the market is low, we have carried out the evaluation using the simulation framework OMNeT++ and the NeSTiNg library. Our evaluation shows that, all in all, TAS performs the best, but it introduces a great configuration overhead. FP and ST can keep up in certain scenarios and their performance can even be improved.

AB  - Compliance with the end-to-end latency of tasks and flows is a safety-relevant constraint in real-time systems. Especially when tasks and flows are interconnected by data dependencies in so-called Cause-Effect Chains, the adherence to end-to-end restrictions becomes even more complex. In our previous work, we proposed the incremental algorithm ITANS, which presents a solution for the joint scheduling of tasks and flows organized in Cause-Effect-Chains in communication networks applying the IEEE 802.1Qbv Time-Aware Shaper. In this work, we extend the approach to communication networks using the scheduling method Strict Priority (SP). The determination of the worst-case transmission time (WCTT) of flows is an essential part of ITANS. To derive the WCTT of flows in SP-based networks, we use the mathematical framework Network Calculus (NC) combining existing analyses to derive the least pessimistic delay guarantees for network flows. The evaluations show that the extension of ITANS can achieve a high success rate and a low runtime on average in systems with Gigabit Ethernet and communication networks that use SP.

AB  - In flexible production systems with distributed control systems which communicate with each other via a real time network, changes in the requirements for real time communication during operation must not lead to a temporary failure of the deterministic communication. Rather, the changes of the network configuration must become active at exactly predictable times in order to guarantee the functionality of the deterministic communication all the time. This paper shows a realization of how the configuration of a real time network schedule under Linux can be adjusted at predetermined times without interrupting the communication. For this purpose, the real time scheduler TAPRIO is integrated into the library libnl, and the performance of this extension is evaluated in a test case. It is shown that the modification of the network configuration is reliably possible in several successive communication cycles.

AB  - This paper proposes an approach to model switched Ethernet communication within a model- and component-based software development framework for vehicular distributed embedded systems. The paper also presents a method to extract the network timing model from the systems that use switched Ethernet networks. In order to provide a proof of concept, an existing industrial component model and its tool suite, namely RCM and Rubus-ICE respectively, are extended by implementing the modeling technique, the timing model extraction method and response-time analysis of the Ethernet AVB protocol. The extensions to RCM are backward compatible with the modeling and end-to-end timing analysis of traditional in-vehicle networks and legacy (previously developed) vehicular distributed embedded systems. Furthermore, the paper discusses the implementation and test strategy used in this work. Finally, the usability of the modeling approach and implemented timing analysis is demonstrated by modeling and time analyzing a vehicular application case study with the extended component model and tool suite.

AB  - The IEEE Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) provides a scalable solution for real-time communication using Ethernet technology. In this paper, we address the availability of FPGA-based TSN under a harsh radiation environment. In particular, the impact of periodic repair mechanisms and the transmission redundancy on the communication availability is investigated. To achieve our goal, we propose a Timed Automata (TA) model of the TSN to capture the impact of periodic repair on communication reliability. As a result, the proposed analysis framework allows the designer to set up the appropriate repair cycle and redundancy level according to the application criticality and required system reliability. To demonstrate the proposed analysis framework, we consider a case study based on the switched network deployed in the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) American-European interplanetary spacecraft. Our analysis results show a specific optimal scrubbing rate for each radiation environment regardless the network utilization conditions.

AB  - This paper studies QoS estimation over an Ethernet-based in-vehicle network with Credit-Based Shaper, which is defined in IEEE 802.1TSN, by simulation. The authors estimate QoS by the method of utilizing the linear multiple regression analysis, which treats QoS parameters and network parameters as objective variables and explanatory ones, respectively. This paper considers the average delay and the maximum one as QoS parameters and evaluates QoS while changing the number of intermediate switches which supports CBS. From the experimental results, the authors confirm the effectiveness the method of estimating QoS over in-vehicle networks with CBS.

AB  - New hard real-time Advanced Driver Assistance Systems such as the Collision-Avoidance System push the bandwidth requirements of the communication infrastructure to a new level. Controller Area Network (CAN) and FlexRay are reaching their limits. Ethernet-based automotive networks such as Ethernet AVB are capable of addressing these requirements. However, designing predictable Ethernet networks is more complex than the design of a traditional CAN bus. Formal real-time performance characteristics are key to a successful Ethernet integration. In this paper we present an improved Ethernet AVB performance analysis which exploits traffic-stream correlations. The results are significantly tighter compared to related work.

AB  - Ethernet has been proposed for the 5G fronthaul to transport the Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) traffic between the radio equipment (RE) and the radio equipment control (REC). The advantages of adopting an Ethernet transport are threefold 1) the low cost of equipment, 2) the use of a shared infrastructure with statistical multiplexing, as well as 3) the ease of operations, administration and maintenance (OAM). In this paper, we introduce distributed timeslot scheduler for CPRI over Ethernet (DTSCoE) as a scheduling algorithm for IEEE 802.1Qbv to support CPRI traffic. DTSCoE is built upon the stream reservation protocol (SRP) IEEE 802.1Qcc to propagate timeslot information across the datapath without any centralized coordination. The simulation results demonstrate that DTSCoE reduces one-way delay to minimum and reduces the jitter to zero which satisfies the CPRI requirements.

AB  - Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is gaining interest in the critical embedded networking community thanks to the various Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms that can be rolled out to offer different levels of determinism to flows in a switched Ethernet network. Among these standards, limited jitter flows can benefit from the Time Aware Shaper (TAS) which requires the deployment of the IEEE802.1AS synchronization. Indeed, TAS assumes a global time with a bounded drift between any two nodes. In this paper, we derive a refined and general mathematical model that offers upper and lower bounds on the worst-case precision that can be applied to different Ethernet technologies. Results for 100Base-T and 1000Base-T technologies are given. Both simulations and empirical measurements validate the almost two times closer upper bound we obtain compared to the state-of-the-art model.

AB  - Motivated by the need to provide a precisely determined delay between source and sink nodes in time-sensitive networks, we propose an architecture that provisions near-zero queuing delay in new Quality-of-Service frameworks, e.g., those of $\mathbf{5G}$ solutions. To this end, various studies have shown how load balancing can reduce delay. Most of these studies consider $N$ parallel processing queues with exponential service rates and Poisson arrivals with mean rate $\lambda$. These queues are handled by a single controller that assigns a new task to the shortest queue. The so-called power-of-d-servers or power-of-d-choices approach was proven to provide necessary delay improvements. In this strategy, the controller allocates the request to the least-loaded server among $d(N), 1\leq d(N)\leq N$ randomly selected servers. However, none of these studies have considered realistic scenarios of fractional resource assignment to flow requests. To address this key shortcoming, we make the following contributions: (1) We design a software-defined network (SDN) controller framework called SOLT that considers the keys aspects of available resources in a time-sensitive network (TSN) setting, (2) We prove theoretically, how these bounds can be achieved and show the necessary conditions for achieving asymptotically zero delays in such networks, and (3) Through simulations, we demonstrate the improvements achieved by SOLT in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB  - Fog Computing for Robotics and Industrial Automation, FORA, was a European Training Network which focused on future industrial automation architectures and applications based on an emerging technology, called Fog Computing. The research project focused on research related to Fog Computing with applicability to industrial automation and manufacturing. The main outcome of the FORA project was the development of a deterministic Fog Computing Platform (FCP) to be used for implementing industrial automation and robotics solutions for Industry 4.0. This paper reports on the scientific outcomes of the FORA project. FORA has proposed a reference system architecture for Fog Computing, which was published as an open Architecture Analysis Design Language (AADL) model. The tech-nologies developed in FORA include fog nodes and hypervisors, resource management mechanisms and middleware for deploying scalable Fog Computing applications, while guaranteeing the non-functional properties of the virtualized industrial control applications, and methods and processes for assuring the safety and security of the FCP. Several industrial use cases were used to evaluate the suitability of the FORA FCP for the Industrial IoT area, and to demonstrate how the platform can be used to develop industrial control applications and data analytics applications.

AB  - Controller Area Network (CAN) and Ethernet network are expected to co-exist in automotive industry as Ethernet provides a high-bandwidth communication, while CAN is a legacy cost-effective solution. Due to the shortcomings of conventional switched Etherent, such as determinism, IEEE Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group developed a set of standards to enhance the switched Ethernet technology providing low-jitter and deterministic communication. Considering these two network domains, we investigate various design approaches for a gateway that connects a CAN domain to a TSN domain. We present three gateway forwarding techniques and we develop end-to-end delay analysis methods for them. Via the analysis methods and applying them to synthetic use cases we show that the intuitive existing approach of encapsulating multiple CAN frames into a single Ethernet frame is not necessarily an efficient solution. In fact, we demonstrate several cases where it is preferable to encapsulate only one CAN frame into a TSN frame, in particular when we use a high speed TSN network. The results have a significant impact on developing such gateways as the implementation of the one-to-one frame encapsulation is considerably simpler than other complex gateway-forwarding techniques.

AB  - Industrie 4.0 reinforces advanced technology development to realize Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) with real-time guarantees. The evolution of traditional industrial- automation systems such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) to cyber-physical systems by means of virtualization is one of the key enhancements. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of the placement of virtual PLCs (vPLCs) at edge clouds in conjunction with scheduling and routing of Time-Triggered (TT) traffic in 802.1Qbv-based industrial networks. We propose two approaches to solve this problem adopting a multi-objective optimization model. In the first approach, we solve separately the problem of placement and scheduling-routing by using a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation. While in the second approach, we propose a Simulated Annealing (SA)- based meta-heuristic to solve the joint placement, scheduling, and routing optimization problem. We compare both the algorithms for real-world test cases and validate our solutions using the OMNeT++ simulator.

AB  - In 5G radio access networks, meeting the performance requirements of the fronthaul network is quite challenging. Recent standardization and research activities are focusing on exploiting the IEEE Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) technology for fronthaul networks. In this work we evaluate the performance of Ethernet TSN networks based on IEEE 802.1Qbv and IEEE 802.1Qbu for carrying real fronthaul traffic and benchmark it against Ethernet with Strict priority and Round Robin scheduling. We demonstrate that both 802.1Qbv and 802.1Qbu can be well used to protect high-priority traffic flows even in overload conditions.

AB  - In this paper we discuss how to handle delay in 5G Ethernet mobile fronthaul networks. The reasons for the delay requirements, addressing both service and protocol specific requirements, are discussed together with prime carrier needs of scalability of networks and easy migration to new network solutions. In light of these carrier needs, we also examine the suitability of different packet switching mechanisms for Time Sensitive Networks (TSN) proposed in scientific literature and standardization.

AB  - Ethernet AVB is being actively considered by the automotive industry as a candidate for in-vehicle communication backbone. However, several questions pertaining to schedulability of hard real-time messages transmitted via such a switch remain unanswered. In this paper, we attempt to fill this void. We derive equations to perform worst-case response time analysis on Ethernet AVB switches by considering its credit-based shaping algorithm. Also, we propose several approaches to reduce the pessimism in the analysis to provide tighter bounds.

AB  - The effort to pursue a greater quality of life has given rise to an entire industry devoted to acquiring technology that produces accurate medical diagnoses in a shorter amount of time than is currently possible. The goal is a very small, self contained system that is available to doctors in offices and to medical personnel in field situations. This goal has nearly been realized through recent advances in micro and nano technologies that allow diagnostic systems to shrink to the size of a microchip. However, as systems shrink in size, smaller sample introduction methods are needed. This paper explores three different possibilities for introducing sample from the macro environment to that of a micro-chip in a Micro Total Analysis (μ-TAS), or Lab-on-Chip (LOC), scenario. In addition to the world-to-chip possibilities, this paper also explores methods to maximize the quantity of sample delivered to specific locations on the chip for processing, while minimizing the chip area. The use of a fixed displacement, solenoid activated micropump, is verified as one method of sample entry. Standard Luer Lock syringes were also used in conjunction with Luer to 1/8 NPT fittings. Finally Hamilton micro syringes were used with UpChurch fluidic interconnects. The chip layouts included several different angles of intersection between two channels, as well as the use of multiple, smaller The three methods are judged on ease of consumer use, ease of manufacturing, and finally overall reliability of the method.

AB  - Existing papers on worst-case response time analysis for individual classes in Ethernet AVB typically focus on classes under credit-based shaping (CBS). There also exist industrial applications that use the Best-Effort class BE for non-hard real-time traffic with a minimum quality-of-service (QoS) require-ment, however. In this paper, we therefore present a conjecture for worst-case response time analysis for that class BE, stating that the existing analysis based on eligible intervals can be equally well applied to a single (highest-priority) stream without CBS, by simply assuming the remaining bandwidth to be available to that stream. The conjecture is illustrated using a figure.

AB  - The existing worst-case response time (WCRT) analysis for individual priority classes under credit-based shaping (CBS) in Ethernet AVB based on so-called eligible intervals is both independent and tight. This WCRT analysis does not rely on any assumptions on interfering inter-priority streams other than those enforced by the Ethernet standard. A major advantage of this independent analysis is that CBS may be viewed as resource reservation, where allocated bandwidth is both guaranteed and enforced. Although independent analysis provides inter-priority class robustness, it comes at a cost of over-provisioning bandwidth. We illustrate this cost of inter-priority class robustness by means of an example that requires 7.8 times the amount of bandwidth reservation for a given set of streams compared to a different analysis that takes knowledge of inter-priority streams into account.

AB  - Real-time communication of distributed automation systems come with many challenges as there is no common time basis. Often a periodic execution of applications is considered which leads to time phenomena like drifts or jitter. Thus, this type of communication requires observance and enforcement of real-time properties to guarantee reliability of distributed systems. New industrial technologies like Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and the IEC 61499 standard provide support to conquer upcoming challenges. Therefore, we are using these jointly with contract-based design to propose a design methodology for verification of real-time communication in IEC 61499 systems. We implemented a simulation-based verification environment and performed postmortem trace-based verification against timing specifications. The evaluation confirms the possibility of integrating our proposed representation for non-local communication into IEC 61499 for analyzing time behavior of applications.

AB  - Offline scheduling of Scheduled Traffic (ST) in Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN) without taking into account the quality of service of non-ST traffic, e.g., time-sensitive traffic such as Audio-Video Bridging (AVB) traffic, can potentially cause deadline misses for non-ST traffic. In this paper, we report our ongoing work to propose a solution that, regardless of the ST scheduling algorithm being used, can ensure meeting timing requirements for non-ST traffic. To do this, we define a frame called Guard Frame (GF) that will be scheduled together with all ST frames. We show that a proper design for the GFs will leave necessary porosity in the ST schedules to ensure that all non-ST traffic will meet their timing requirements.

AB  - Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is about to enter automotive networks based on the SOME/IP middleware and an Ethernet high-bandwidth communication layer. It promises to meet the growing demands on connectivity and flexibility for software components in modern cars. Largely heterogeneous service requirements and time-sensitive network functions make Quality-of-Service (QoS) agreements a vital building block within future automobiles. Existing middleware solutions, however, do not allow for a dynamic selection of QoS. This paper presents a service-oriented middleware for QoS aware communication in future cars. We contribute a protocol for dynamic QoS negotiation along with a multi-protocol stack, which supports the different communication classes as derived from a thorough requirements analysis. We validate the feasibility of our approach in a case study and evaluate its performance in a simulation model of a realistic in-car network. Our findings indicate that QoS aware communication can indeed meet the requirements, while the impact of the service negotiations and setup times of the network remain acceptable provided the cross-traffic during negotiations stays below 70% of the available bandwidth.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) technology is key to the development of current networks due to its capacity to provide a deterministic Quality of Service (QoS) mainly in terms of delay for different industrial traffic. It also simplifies management and improves the scalability of industrial networks. This articles focuses on Asynchronous Traffic Shape (ATS) for TSN. The key aspect of ATS is that by prioritizing flows delay requirement can be satisfied for each priority level. To that end, we formally formulate the problem of flow priority assignment in an network and we demonstrate the optimality of our proposed algorithm. We have compared our algorithm with the brute force search obtaining that the execution time of brute force is much higher than ours with exactly the same prioritization results.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an emerging topic for the advancement of wireless networking for industrial applications. TSN, as defined under the umbrella of IEEE 802.1 working group standards, addresses issues related to providing deterministic communications over IEEE 802-based Local Area Networks (LANs). TSN was originally designed to support real-time audio/video applications over Ethernet providing better reliability and lower, more deterministic latency with traffic shaping capabilities. TSN has since expanded its scope and applicability to other applications such as those in industrial environments and automotive applications. Industrial examples include machine-machine communications for robot control, end-effector actuation, real-time sensing, and safety integrated systems. Applications utilizing a wireless local area network (WLAN) can also benefit from scheduling and traffic shaping as defined in the 802.1Qbv standard; however, factors such as clock stability, synchronization, resource requirements and protocol options come into play when selecting a schedule to support multiple application types on the same network. In this article, we present a scenario for a collaborative robot heavy lift operation, in which, two robots communicate over an IEEE 802.11 WLAN with TSN capabilities to lift a rigid body in three dimensions. Scheduling is performed using 802.1Qbv over WLAN with the robot operating system (ROS) used as the software middleware utilizing the transport control protocol (TCP). As a part of the research, we describe our process for schedule selection to accommodate the time-sensitive traffic of the robotic scenario while allowing an industrial internet of things (IIoT) high data rate traffic to coexist. We then provide an analysis of the impacts of TSN schedule selection on the operational performance of the collaborative robot application.

AB  - The continuous exposure to high levels of atmospheric pollution can cause harmful effects on the population health and environment. Technology advances in communication networks and air pollution sensors allow the development of low-cost systems for the management of the air quality in cities. The deployment of a large number of sensors provides a better geographic and temporal resolution, and it complements the traditional monitoring networks. In this work, we present an experience in the city of La Plata, Argentina, where an air quality monitoring system for urban areas was assembled. This system is based on a LoRaWAN network, and uses free hardware and software environments. All the sensed information is transmitted to a scalable platform for IoT in the cloud, where we can process the received data, monitor the network state and generate statistics. In this first experience, we test 3 different models of sensors (Nova SDS011, Nova SDS021 y SHINYEI PPD42) in combination with a low volume sampler of particulate matter, MiniVol TAS Airmetrics. The results obtained until the moment provide a contribution to the construction of future Smart Cities.

AB  - Ethernet TSN is an upcoming communication standard for industrial distributed embedded systems with high demands on bandwidth and traffic delay. In this paper, we present and prove an improved analysis to determine bandwidth reservations for credit based shapers in a single Ethernet TSN switch. We compare this new analysis, which is based on eligible intervals, to the state-of-the-art bandwidth reservation analysis based on busy periods through experiments. Despite its low complexity and the independence of the knowledge of the interfering traffic, the results show an improvement of efficiency, i.e., a decrease of the required bandwidth, for the new analysis.

AB  - Busy period analysis is often used as a basis for worst-case response time analysis of priority based systems. However, when shaping strategies are used to prevent starvation of lower priorities, it becomes difficult to achieve tightness results using this method. The reason for this is that a busy period is defined as the longest interval in which there exists pending load. It is exclusively based on execution time, and does not take the amount of provided bandwidth into account. As a consequence, it is less suitable for the study of idling systems. In particular, we do not yet have tightness results regarding the analysis of the Ethernet AVB standard, in which credit-based shaping is applied. In this paper, we propose an alternative to the use of busy periods. We show that, by defining an eligible interval in such a way that provisioning is taken into account, tight worst-case response time bounds can more easily be obtained for Ethernet AVB, at least in the case of either lower-or higher-priority interference.

AB  - The growing number of IoT devices has brought about a large number of time-sensitive applications, and time-sensitive networks (TSN) are widely regarded as promoting paradigm for enabling the deterministic transmission. However, most of the existing research is based on the static network where the flow information is known a priori, and the transmission scheduling scheme is synthesized offline. This makes their design mechanism unsuitable for industrial automation scenarios with equipment changes and flow changes. Meanwhile, joint routing and scheduling faces the problem of large search space and high algorithm complexity, which poses a challenge to how to solve the problem within the acceptable time range of dynamic scenarios.We present PRIS, an algorithm that combines pre-routing and online incremental scheduling. Considering the periodicity of time-sensitive flow, the pre-routing algorithm uses weight factors including scheduling compatibility and load balancing as routing indicators. The online incremental scheduling based on Cyclic-Queuing and Forwarding(CQF), which was proposed by IEEE 802.1 to achieve bounded delay transmission. Based on CQF, our PRIS is designed to be flexible and with high schedulability, low execution time. Simulation results show PRIS has a high scheduling success rate of 92.7% at 150 new flows in feasible sub-second execution time.

AB  - Modern in-vehicle applications, such as automated driving, require hardware and software platforms that integrate multiple processing units with specialized hardware and virtualization support. Such platforms need a communication system able to offer several properties, such as, support for different realtime traffic classes, high reliability, and clock synchronization. The IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking is the candidate technology for meeting these requirements, and therefore recent work has proposed a novel framework to support TSN in heterogeneous platforms with virtualization. This work presents an experimental assessment of such a novel framework and provides experimental results that offer quantitative insights on the framework performance.

AB  - To maximize the overall performance yield, variation-aware analysis is becoming a key step in Multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MP-SoC) Task Allocation and Scheduling (TAS). Although various approaches have been investigated to improve performance yields, most of them cannot perform quantitative comparison among existing TAS heuristics, which is important for MPSoC designers to make decisions. Based on the statistical model checker UPPAAL-SMC, we propose a framework that can automatically evaluate the performance yield of TAS strategies under time and power constraints with variations. Experimental results show that our approach can not only filter inferior strategies efficiently, but also support the automated tuning of architecture and constraint parameters to achieve the required performance yield.

AB  - With the advent of 5G and the evolution of Internet protocols, industrial applications are moving from vertical solutions to general purpose IP-based infrastructures that need to meet deterministic Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. The IETF DetNet working group aims at providing an answer to this need with support for (i) deterministic worst-case latency and jitter, and (ii) zero packet loss for time-sensitive traffic. In particular, this working group is currently specifying Cycle Specified Queuing and Forwarding (CSQF), an extension of Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) with multiple transmission queues and support for Segment Routing (SR).In this paper, we present a load balancing extension for DetNet that aims at improving network utilization. In order to implement this additional feature, we show how to extend the original SR policy in CSQF. Then, we formulate the optimization problem that a centralized controller has to solve to produce feasible load balancing configurations and we demonstrate on a typical 3-tiers topology that load balancing improves traffic acceptance as the complexity of finding the optimal configurations increases.

AB  - In the past decades, the evolution of Industrial Inter-net of Things (IIoT) and Industry 4.0 faces several challenges, and one of them is the proprietary network which causes a rising cost due to the interoperability, compatibility, and strict requirements. To deal with the challenge, industry advocates an open Ethernet-based standard under the IEEE 802.1 family, named Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), to support real-time and critical applications, where the routing with TSN is still an open and ongoing research problem. Although there are some existing routing approaches, they are offline algorithms and thus not suitable for future industrial automation that needs to support dynamic reconfiguration. Also, they consider either only TSN traffic or only AVB traffic to determine the routing paths, which limits the overall solution space and fails to make the best use of TSN features. To address the issues above, we aim to explore an online routing problem considering both TSN and AVB traffic in a TSN network. It is very first to investigate the online routing problem considering both TSN and AVB traffic. We propose an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based approach with a low time complexity to solve the problem. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms a well-known solution in terms of the schedulability, performance, number of rerouted streams, and computational efficiency.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN) enable real-time communication guarantees over Ethernet by defining a timed-gate mechanism (802.1Qbv), binding frame transmissions to a global schedule, and a synchronization protocol (802.1AS), which aligns the time of each node to a reference clock. When the reference clock is lost, the individual clocks drift apart until a new master clock is elected (re-synchronization interval). This may lead to a complete loss of determinism due to an inconsistent alignment of the transmission patterns between nodes.In this paper, we address the problem of creating time-triggered schedules for 802.1Qbv with an enhanced robustness against the temporary loss of synchronization. We analyze the protocol behavior upon a loss of synchronization and derive new constraints for the computation of schedules able to tolerate the worst-case drift of individual clocks during the resynchronization interval. Moreover, we formulate the problem as a design space exploration to synthesize schedules with the maximum tolerance towards loss-of-sync issues. We have developed a scheduler tool based on the Z3 SMT/OMT solver and conducted a series of experiments with a set of synthetic use-cases. Our evaluation exposes a series of trade-offs between the robustness of the schedule and the feasibility and computation run-time of the scheduler as well as the end-to-end communication latency.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a set of standardised communication protocols developed under the IEEE 802.1 working group. TSN aims to support deterministic communication based on network schedules that are distributively configured. It is widely considered as the future in-vehicle network solution for highly automated driving, where the requirement on timing guarantee is alongside the demand of high communication bandwidth. In this work, we study a setting of periodic control and non-control packets, with implicit and arbitrary deadlines, respectively. As the FIFO (first-in, first-out) queues in the 802.1Qbv switch incur long delay in the worst case, which prevents the control tasks from achieving short sampling periods and thus impedes control performance optimisation, we propose the first fixed-priority scheduling (FPS) approach for TSN by leveraging its gate control features. In this context, we develop a finer-grained frame-level response time analysis, which provides a tighter bound than the conventional packet-level analysis. Building upon FPS and the above analysis, we formulate a co-design optimisation problem to decide the sampling periods and poles of real-time controllers with settling time as the objective to minimise, whilst satisfying the schedulability constraint.

AB  - This article presents the overall development philosophy followed to setup the PVA Factory 4.0, Thales Alenia Space (TAS) flagship for an Industry 4.0 production environment for the manufacturing and testing of Photo Voltaic Assemblies (PVA) in Belgium. Starting from a blank page, the process and means of this new facility were conceived and developed in a hardware-driven testing approach, relying on the extensive heritage of TAS for designing solar arrays and manufacturing of power electronics. Two main application cases have driven the development: (1) the heritage GEO PVA, which requires demonstrating equivalence to existing manufacturers solution in Fit-Form-Function. (2) “New Space” PVA with a requirement of high throughput, enabling a stronger design-for-manufacturing approach. This paper presents how we used a new way of assessing product quality inherited from other terrestrial industries, Advanced Product Quality Planning (APQP), to orient the development of the various process and means required to launch this new activity at TAS.

AB  - The selection of a Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) shaping mechanism is a crucial design decision that impacts the Quality of Service (QoS) of applications and configuration complexity. However, current research has mainly evaluated TSN shapers individually, despite them being designed to work together in an egress port. Hence, the lack of investigation of the mixed TSN shaping mechanism is a major limitation of the current state of the art. Combined TSN traffic shaping provides greater flexibility to improve QoS than individual shapers, making it particularly beneficial for real-time applications. This paper aims to bridge this research gap by implementing the Asynchronous Traffic Shaper (ATS) in a plug-and-play manner, enabling its use individually or in combination with other TSN shapers. We propose various models of mixed TSN shaper architectures and implement the frozen and non-frozen credit behavior of the Time Aware Shaper (TAS) + Credit Based Shaper (CBS) during the guard band (GB) using OMNeT++. Furthermore, we compare the simulation results of ATS and CBS with the Network Calculus (NC) upper bounds. Our results indicate that the simulated delays (SMDs) were significantly lower than the theoretical worst-case delays (WCDs) obtained from the NC, indicating the need for tighter theoretical upper bounds, particularly for higher network loads. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide simulation-based performance analysis of the combined $\text{TAS}+\text{ATS}+\text{CBS}$ and $\text{TAS}+\text{ATS}+\text{Strict}$ Priority (SP) architecture. Overall, this paper highlights the benefits of combining TSN shapers and encourages further research into the potential advantages of utilizing multiple shapers simultaneously to decrease reliance on TAS and CBS.

AB  - Worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis is a prevalent way to ensure the timely execution of programs in time-critical systems. With the advent of new technologies such as fog computing and time-sensitive networking (TSN), the interest in timing analysis has increased in industrial communication. This paper highlights experiences made while adjusting the publisher of the open62541 OPC UA stack to enable WCET analysis, following a simple process combined with the open-source platform T-CREST. The main challenges are the required knowledge about the code and the specific communication software characteristics like variable message sizes. Other findings indicate the need for other types of annotation for indirect recursion or callback functions. The paper provides the foundation for further research on adjusting the implementation of existing industrial communication protocols for WCET analysis.

A stepping stone is end-to-end real-time machine-to-machine communication, now becoming feasible with technologies such as time-sensitive networking (TSN) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) publish-subscribe. While TSN takes care of communication, the OPC UA stack's execution time behavior remains unknown. This paper highlights experiences made while adjusting the OPC UA subscriber of the open62541 stack for worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis. Two directly connected time-predictable T-CREST platforms hosting the publisher and subscriber delivered end-to-end timing measures validating the WCET estimates. The paper concludes by outlining further research with several time-predictable publishers and subscribers.

AB  - The ongoing transition in industrial automation towards a highly interconnected architecture underscores the importance of time-sensitive networking (TSN). This paper addresses the implementation of a time-predictable software-based TSN-enabled network stack for mixed criticality traffic in TSN end stations. The findings demonstrate the network stack’s worst-case execution time (WCET) analysability, effective management of mixed critical traffic, and real-time transmission of UDP frames. Additionally, the stack offers modularity, configurability, and TSN support for transferring messages across different priorities using either UDP or TCP. Evaluation on the time-predictable open-source T-CREST platform yields representative WCET estimates comparable to related research. The paper concludes by outlining further research.

AB  - Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of standards aimed at providing real-time guarantees over existing Ethernet standards. Worst-case traversal time (WCTT) analyses of network traffic are traditionally used in schedulability and routing analyses to determine feasible routes for traffic streams. However, worst-case conditions happen quite rarely from a probabilistic perspective. The typical or average-case traversal times are easier to compute and can be used as an effective design tool for routing and scheduling. In this paper, we present "MaLoC" or Maximally Loaded Common links for routing and scheduling of rate-constrained (RC) traffic in time-sensitive networks (TSN). The proposed framework employs a fully decentralized approach to route and schedule generation with only switch-local information. We further provide a preliminary evaluation of the proposed approach using a simple network topology.

AB  - Tight end-to-end worst-case delay bounds for periodic traffic streams are essential for time sensitive networks. In this paper, we provide an algorithm to compute a tight (and accurate) end-to-end worst-case bound by considering distinct topological patterns and the manner in which streams enter and leave switches. This refined analysis uses non-preemptive, strict-priority arbitration mechanism commonly deployed in Ethernet switches. Compared to the state-of-the-art that considers all higher and equal priority interference as contributing to the worst-case bound, we present an analytical approach for computing a tighter worst-case delay bound and prove through discrete event simulations that only a certain number of equal-priority interference streams can actually affect the worst-case case. Our results enable efficient resource allocation and have implications for online re-configuration mechanisms for time-sensitive factory communication systems.

AB  - Time sensitive networking (TSN) is gaining attention in industrial automation networks since it brings essential real-time capabilities to the Ethernet layer. Safety-critical realtime applications based on TSN require both timeliness as well as fault-tolerance guarantees. The TSN standard 802.1CB introduces seamless redundancy mechanisms for time-sensitive data whereby each data frame is sequenced and duplicated across a redundant link to prevent single points of failure (most commonly, link failures). However, a major shortcoming of 802.1CB is the lack of fault detection mechanisms which can result in unnecessary replications even under good link conditions - clearly inefficient in terms of bandwidth use. This paper proposes a machine learning-based intelligent configuration synthesis mechanism that enhances bandwidth utilization by replicating frames only when a link has a higher propensity for failure.

AB  - Predictable and low-latency communication timing is one of the major challenges for employing Ethernet-based networks in industrial automation. The evolving Ethernet AVB standard appears to be a promising architecture, as it provides mechanisms for predictable timing with standard Ethernet hardware. However, the worst-case timing of Ethernet AVB still has to be evaluated. In this paper, we analyze the timing of Ethernet AVB using both simulation and a formal worst-case analysis based on Compositional Performance Analysis known from embedded computing systems. We investigate two industrial scenarios, a typical line topology and a more complex two-level network, and compare the results from analysis and simulation. This allows us get a good indication of the applicability of the current Ethernet AVB with respect to predictable low-latency timing in industrial automation networks. We also gain an understanding of the benefits and limitations of formal Compositional Performance Analysis compared to simulation in this context.

AB  - Ethernet is increasingly recognized as the future communication standard for distributed embedded systems in multiple domains such as industrial automation, automotive and avionics. A main motivation for this is cost and available data rate. A critical issue in the adoption of Ethernet in these domains is the timing of frame transfers, as many relevant applications require a guaranteed low-latency communication in order to meet real-time constraints. Ethernet AVB is an upcoming standard which addresses the timing issues by extending the existing strict-priority arbitration. Still, it needs to be evaluated whether these mechanism suffice for the targeted applications. For safety-critical applications, this can not only be done using intuition or simulation but requires a formal approach to assure the coverage of all worst-case corner cases. Hence, we present in this paper a formal worst-case analysis of the timing properties of Ethernet AVB and strict-priority Ethernet. This analysis mathematically determines safe upper bounds on the latency of frame transfers. Using this approach, we evaluate different topologies for a typical use-case in industrial automation.

AB  - Aiming at the coexistence of periodic packets and discrete packets in the Industrial Internet of Things(IIoT), and the low latency and high reliability requirements of industrial applications, this paper proposes a new algorithm called Time-sensitive Network Resource Scheduling Algorithm in IP Protocol (TSIPA) based on the theory of hybrid systems. TSIPA algorithm is also one of the feasible solutions to the problem of heterogeneous network integration in the Industrial Internet of Things. The packet priority, transmission time and maximum transmission delay of a single packet are considered in the TSIPA algorithm. Simulation experiments verified that the TSIPA algorithm satisfies the transmission requirements of packets with high packet priority, while basically controlling the average transmitted time of the queue to be sent within the required range, and reducing the packet loss rate.

AB  - The uncertainty, aroused from the burst of stochastic traffic, will increase the delay of periodic traffic in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). To confront this challenge, a novel stochastic flow model based on the budget constraint uncertainty set is proposed to obtain interval prediction of future time points. Considering the coupling relationship between multiple periods, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is first established to cut the redundant part of the box set, and the budget constraints are gradually generated. In addition, with the consideration of the strong correlation between adjacent periods, another kind of budget constraint is further introduced into the mentioned uncertainty set such that the accuracy of the uncertainty set can be further improved. Based on the uncertainty set with budget constraints, a group of linear inequalities covering the traffic data of future first-time points is established and thus prediction interval can be given by solving the inequalities. Finally, the stochastic traffic prediction interval results of several time points in the future can be obtained via rolling prediction technology. Numerical tests are implemented with the actual data to verify the efficiency of the budget uncertainty set.

AB  - Technological advancements in modern vehicles facilitate active research on the Ethernet-based Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) protocol to overcome the limitations of traffic processing in the traditional In-Vehicle Network (IVN) domain. Several TSN traffic processing studies focus on the process between the Switch (SW) or between the SW and End System (ES). However, traffic processing between the ES and subordinate nodes needs to integrate a TSN into an existing IVN. In this study, we compared the performance of the time-synchronized Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) approach and the non-time synchronized Asynchronous Traffic Shaper (ATS) approach (based on Token Bucket Emulation (TBE) and Length Rate Quotient (LRQ) algorithms) for traffic processing between the ES and subordinate nodes. The analysis revealed that the ATS approach based on the TBE algorithm exhibited the most stable performance in the given traffic model, whereas the TAS approach exhibited superior performance for high-priority traffic.

AB  - Smart grid substation automation and protection applications are time-critical, since any real time constraint violation may result in disastrous consequences. However, meeting real time requirements in Substation Communication Networks (SCN) is a challenging issue. To address the various real time requirements, the IEC 61850 standard specifies several application protocols that were based on Ethernet but is recently moving to TSN (Time Sensitive Networking). This raises the following question: is TSN always relevant for SCN? This paper attempts to answer this question through a comparison of traditional switched Ethernet and the Time Aware Shaper (TAS) mechanism associated with the TSN standard. We highlight the difficulty in answering the question simulating scenarios in which TAS is relevant and others in which it is not. We conclude by making some recommendations for using the TAS of TSN in SCN.

AB  - IEC 61850 has become the reference standard for Substation Automation Systems (SAS) in smart power grids. Current IEC 61850 compliant SAS use Ethernet technology for both Event-Triggered (ET) and Time-Triggered (TT) traffic to transport highly critical messages requiring low-latency guarantees. However the real-time guarantee is often achieved by over-provisioning network resources. In this paper we study the potentials of using Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) in SAS. TSN adds real-time enhancement to the existing IEEE 802.1Q standard by providing several new traffic shapers. If TT traffic can be guaranteed by scheduling its transmission at the right time using TSN time-aware shaper, it is not the case for ET traffic. The paper contribution is twofold: proposing a first mapping of the IEC 61850 protocols to the TSN traffic classes, based on the analysis of both TSN and IEC 61850 protocols; and developing an exact worst-case delay (WCD) analysis for ET traffic. The tightness of the developed WCD analysis has be shown by simulations.

AB  - IEEE 802.1Qbv introduces the time-aware shaper that controls traffic egress from a certain port for Time-sensitive networking. Conventional studies for the TAS hardly consider guidelines that regulate the scheduling order of traffic for scheduling synthesis. Therefore, this study investigates how scheduling precedence, allocating order of traffic to TAS time schedules, affects the performance of the TAS scheduling. The study identifies that changing the scheduling precedence for traffics shows that traffics have different end-to-end delays. Fur-thermore, this study suggests that higher scheduling precedence is appropriate for traffic with shorter time slot lengths. The sim-ulation result shows that the suggestion makes traffics of several sampling sets have their minimum end-to-end delays. Such a consequence may provide some considerations for designing more realistic, general TSN networks.

AB  - Time-Aware Shaper(TAS), as an vitally important synchronous scheduling mechanism in Time-Sensitive Networks(TSN), is defined by the IEEE 802.1 Qbv [1] standard. TAS achieves non-waiting transmission of Time-Triggered(TT) streams by using Gate Control List(GCL). This paper analyzes the end-to-end(E2E) latency of time-sensitive flows when using the TAS mechanism. We built a testing platform using TSN switches and a professional tester. In the presence of background flows, we changed some key parameters and conducted multiple sets of tests. The test results indicate that when the TAS mechanism takes effect, it can achieve bounded latency for high priority traffic. In addition, ensuring the match between the arrival of high priority traffic and the GCL is a prerequisite for the high-performance operation of TAS.

AB  - The introduction of IEEE Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) enables the design of real-time and mission-critical networks based on Ethernet technologies. Apart from providing necessary tools for near-deterministic scheduling, TSN comes with further functionalities for configurability, security, and reliability. IEEE 802.1CB Frame Replication and Elimination (FRER) is the only protocol in the TSN toolbox for adding fault-tolerance via sending the same packets via redundant paths. Although its core functions are defined by the standard, its effective use mainly depends on the actual deployment scenario and the path selection strategy. In this paper, we show that FRER can induce unintentional elimination of packets packets when the paths chosen for a particular packet flow are non-disjoint. We propose the new metric reassurance that can be used in FRER path selection. Besides, we propose an additional enhancement to FRER that can prevent unintended packet eliminations independent from the deployment scenario. Our simulation results indicate that the reassurance-based path selection performs better than random or maximum-disjoint path selection in random failure scenarios.

AB  - IEEE 802.1 Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) enables real-time communication with deterministically bounded network delay and jitter over standard IEEE 802.3 networks (“Ethernet”). In particular, TSN specifies a time-triggered scheduling mechanism in IEEE Std 802.1Qbv implemented by switches to control when outgoing queues get access to switch ports. Besides this time-triggered scheduling mechanism, other scheduling mechanisms can be active in the network at the same time including priority queuing and a credit-based shaper. Moreover, further supporting mechanisms such as the possibility to interrupt frames already in transmission (frame preemption) are specified by the TSN standards. Overall, this leads to a complex network infrastructure transporting both, real-time and non-real-time traffic in one converged network, making it hard to analyze the behavior of converged networks. To facilitate the analysis of TSN networks, we present TSN-specific extensions to the popular OMNeT++/INET framework for network simulations in this paper including, in particular, the time-triggered scheduling mechanism of IEEE Std 802.1Qbv. Besides the design of the TSN simulator, we present a proof-of-concept implementation and exemplary evaluation of TSN networks.

AB  - To extend industrial Ethernet to guarantee real-time quality-of-service (QoS), the IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group has been developing a series of specifications, including the flow control series, of which Credit-Based Shaping (CBS) and Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) were defined in IEEE 802.1 Qav standard and IEEE 802.1 Qcr draft respectively. While CBS is a per-class scheduling strategy, ATS is a per-flow scheduling. To analyze performance of these flow control strategies, comparison among CBS, ATS and Strict Priority Queuing (SPQ) is performed using a suite of self-developed models. Models were implemented and operated in the OMNeT++ simulation platform. Moreover, CBS and ATS are implied in different network load. And the results show that ATS flow control strategy can provide better real time performance guarantee for aperiodic traffics than CBS in heavy network load.

AB  - To fulfill the real-time requirement in various scenarios, such as Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group (TG) have been proposing flow control strategies. As an implementation of per-class flow control strategy, Credit Based Shaping (CBS) space out the Audio/Video (A/V) frames to reduce bursting and bunching as well as protect A/V frames from being interfered. However, CBS provides coarse-grained service, which means the real-time performance for each flow cannot be provided individually. In this paper, we propose Token Regulated Credit Based Shaper (TRCBS), which is an extension of CBS. Unlike CBS, TRCBS operates each flow and can provide the fine-grained service. Based on simulations and evaluations operated in OMNeT++, the performance of TRCBS was qualified analyzed. Furthermore, the comparison between CBS and TRCBS was shown. And TRCBS can even provide better real-time guarantee as well as fine-grained QoS for the flows in the network.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a promising technology that meets the deterministic communication needs of real-time transmission. Time-triggered (TT) streams are the kind of streams that have a high priority in TSN. As the scale of load and topology in real industrial scenarios keeps growing, the difficulty of scheduling TT streams also increases. Incremental scheduling is a common way to improve scalability, but it can lead to a decrease in schedulability. This paper mainly focuses on how to take both scalability and schedulability into account for TT streams in TSN. We propose the incompatibility degree as a measure of stream interaction and, furthermore, an incompatibility-aware joint routing and partitioned scheduling (IA/JRPS) mechanism. IA/JRPS uses partitioned scheduling technique to improve scalability. Meanwhile, we establish incompatibility-aware multi-path routing as well as stream partitioning and sorting techniques to improve schedulability. The experimental results verify that IA/JRPS significantly improves computational efficiency on the premise of ensuring a high scheduling success rate compared with baseline methods.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of new standards which is being developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers to support mixed-criticality requirements based on Ethernet technology. These standards have recently raised the attention of real-time domains such as automation and automotive. To support tight timing guarantees, Time-Aware Shaper (IEEE 802.1Qbv) is introduced based on the theory of time-triggered communication. However, the configuration of Time-Aware Shaper requires expertise and is a time consuming procedure. We aim to automate this procedure reducing configuration overhead. A novel graphical modeling is introduced which combines the strengths of model-based and logic programming modeling paradigms. Using the graphical editor, network topology, dataflow based on a publisher and subscriber concept, and the quality of service requirements are specified. Facts for a network knowledge base are automatically derived from the model. This knowledge base is used to generate constraints for schedule synthesis. These constraints are solved using a Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver to find a correct schedule. Moreover, we exploit the solver's capability of producing unsatisfiable cores and use it for network model correction. We annotated all generated schedule constraints and mapped them to the stream names to track the unsatisfiable streams from the solver's output. We gained insightful results showing that this information significantly helps to correct an unsatisfiable network model to find a feasible schedule.

AB  - Ethernet-compatible interconnections can be widely used in avionics due to its flexibility and scalability. With the growing demand for high bandwidth, low latency, and reliability, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has been proposing a series of standards to improve the real-time performance of Ethernet, among which flow control strategies including Credit Based Shaping (CBS), Time-Aware Shaping (TAS), and Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) have been applied.Taking advantage of the globally synchronized clock, the TAS mechanism can achieve low latency for Time-Triggered (TT) traffic communication by establishing completely non-overlapping time windows, with the difficulties in higher system complexity. Using the token bucket shaping method, ATS can provide per-flow logical isolation for AVB traffic without the need for global clock synchronization. However, the improper parameter configuration of Committed Information Rate (CIR) and Committed Burst Rate (CBS) in ATS will lead to a dramatic rise in transmission latency.In this paper, to realize timing gate control under low complexity, a design of the flow control strategy, Gate Controlled Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (GCATS), which incorporates the Gate Control List (GCL) of TAS into the token bucket shaping method, is introduced. With the clock synchronization on the current node, GCATS reshapes traffic using an ATS-like per-flow token bucket method, reducing the computational cost and time constraints caused by the global clock synchronization of TAS. Simulation results show that, compared to TAS, GCATS configured with GCL tables of different granularity can provide fine-grained service for lower-priority traffic and reduce the transmission delay, that is, when given a default GCL, GCATS serves specific traffic without the need for network-wide clock synchronization.

AB  - Time Sensitive Network (TSN) is a high-quality realtime transmission network with bounded transmission delay, low transmission jitter and extremely low data loss rate. This paper studies the application-level scheduling problem of time-triggered traffic in time-sensitive networks. Firstly, we define a network systematization model, which communicates through time-triggered traffic classes, and treats tasks and network communication as the same scheduling problem, and search the whole solution space. Secondly, the design goal is set to minimize the total delay of all applications, use the defined model to construct logical constraints, and correctly describe the combination of network and task scheduling. At the same time, unnecessary constraints are reduced and the scheduling model is simplified. Finally, a comprehensive method of distributed system application layer scheduling using time-triggered traffic in Ethernet communication is proposed. Different optimization goals are considered in the method, and the work is focused on application-level optimization. The experimental evaluation uses various comprehensive network topologies and system configurations, which show that the comprehensive scheduling method can effectively solve the scheduling problem and meet the requirements of time-critical tasks.

AB  - In this paper, we model and analyse the timing performance of an extended AFDX standard, incorporating the Burst Limiting Shaper (BLS) proposed by the Time Sensitive Networking group. The extended AFDX will enable the interconnection of different avionics domains with mixed-criticality levels, e.g., current AFDX traffic, Flight Control and In-Flight Entertainment. First, we present the model and the worst-case timing analysis, using the Network Calculus framework, of such an extended AFDX to infer real-time guarantees. Secondly, we conduct its performance evaluation on a representative AFDX configuration. Results show the tightness of the proposed model, with reference to simulation results. Moreover, they confirm the efficiency of incorporating the BLS in the AFDX standard to noticeably enhance the medium priority level delay bounds, while respecting the higher priority level constraints, in comparison with the current AFDX standard.

AB  - The number of smart devices connected to the Internet is growing at an enormous pace and will reach 30 billion within the next five years. A large fraction of these devices have limited processing capabilities and energy supply, which makes the execution of computation-intensive cryptographic algorithms very costly. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that basic optimization techniques like loop unrolling can not (always) be applied since cryptographic software for the IoT often needs to meet strict constraints on code size to not exceed the program storage capacity of the target device. In this paper we introduce SECCCM3, a "lightweight" software library for scalable elliptic curve cryptography on ARM Cortex-M3 microcontrollers. The current version of SECCCM3 is able to carry out variable-base scalar multiplication on Montgomery-form curves over pseudo-Mersenne prime fields, such as Curve25519, and can be used to implement static ECDH key exchange. SECCCM3 is scalable in the sense that it supports curves of different order (as long as certain conditions are met), thereby enabling trade-offs between security and execution time (resp. energy dissipation). We made an effort to protect the field arithmetic against Timing Attacks (TAs) and Simple Power Analysis (SPA), taking into account the so-called early-termination effect of the Cortex-M3 integer multiplier, which makes the latency of "long" multiply instructions operand-dependent. Our experiments show that the integration of countermeasures against information leakage caused by this effect increases the execution time by 34%, while the code size grows by 13%. A TA and SPA-resistant scalar multiplication on Curve25519 has an execution time of 4.565 million clock cycles and consumes approximately 2.3 mJ of energy when executed on a STM32L152RE Cortex-M3 microcontroller. SECCCM3 has a binary code size of 4.0 kB, which includes domain parameters for curves over 159, 191, 223, and 255-bit prime fields.

AB  - As a new computing mode, edge computing moves computing, storage and network resources to edge nodes close to users, providing lower latency and better user experience for various applications. At the same time, the rapidly growing number of Internet users and traffic scale have also posed many challenges to edge nodes in the network. Among them, the traffic shaping and scheduling mechanism of edge nodes has become a key research issue. In this paper, an edge node network model using Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) mechanism is considered, and the end-to-end delay bound of the interested flow in this scenario is derived using Network Calculus theory. Based on the theoretical analysis method proposed in this paper, the upper bound of the number of users that can be connected to the network and the lower bound of the service resources provided by edge nodes are obtained. The findings of this study provide practical implications for the planning and resource allocation of edge nodes in scenarios like industrial Internet.

AB  - The recent trend of moving cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the network is reshaping the way applications and their middleware supports are designed, deployed, and operated. This new model envisions a continuum of virtual resources between the traditional cloud and the network edge, which is potentially more suitable to meet the heterogeneous Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the supported application domains. Yet, mission-critical applications such as those in manufacturing, automation, or automotive, still rely on communication standards like the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) protocol and 5G to ensure a deterministic network behavior: in this context, virtualization might introduce unacceptable network perturbations. In this paper, we demonstrate that latency-sensitive applications can execute in virtual machines without disruptions to their network operations. We propose a novel approach to support the TSN protocol in virtual machines through a precise clock synchronization method and we implement it in integration with state-of-the-art and highly-efficient network virtualization techniques. Our experimental results show that it is possible to achieve deterministic and ultra-low latency end-to-end communication in the cloud continuum, for example providing a guaranteed sub-millisecond latency between remote virtual machines.

AB  - We demonstrate that, for periodic systems with offsets (tasks or flows of messages within a time-triggered network), the simulation cycle can be confined to the range of [0, hyperperiod) only under the condition that an idle point exists at the hyper-period. Furthermore, we establish that ensuring both (1) contention-freedom and (2) that no offset exceeds the value of the period minus duration, is a sufficient condition to guarantee the presence of an idle point at the hyper-period. Most contemporary methods aiming to eliminate latency are implicitly based on these properties and fail to propose a schedule if the input system does not allow a contention-free solution. Consequently, we propose a heuristic approach to scheduling periodic flows of frames within time-triggered networks. Our method focuses on minimizing latency, without necessitating a solution where every frame at every output port is contention-free, and it effectively manages the cyclicity problem.

AB  - Static configurations in Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) using the Time-aware Shaper allow precise calculations of deterministic, tight bandwidth and latency guarantees for realtime industrial application streams. It is, however, this static configuration which makes introducing flexible changes to a running TSN system at runtime very hard. Scenarios of adaptive TSN networks envision that the network configuration evolves with time in accordance to anticipated changes such as the dynamicity of machine formations and machine reconfigurations. In this paper, we propose a notion of flexibility of scheduler configurations along a network path that facilitates introducing changes to TSN network configurations at runtime. Based on this notion, we develop and analyze algorithms to incrementally reconfigure TSN using the Time-Aware Shaper. These reconfigurations include determining the admissibility of new or changed streams that may possess individual deadlines.

AB  - The communication in safety-critical networked systems, disregarding usage areas, has to meet stringent reliability and timeliness requirements (colloquially known as deterministic requirements). The fake news can affect even the safety-critical networked systems; the networked systems used in safety-critical areas are usually dynamic. The on-fly addition of components and traffic increases the vulnerability of the networked system exposing it to cyber-attacks. Example of these attacks are: denial of service, Fake-Data Injection (FDI) and replay.The goal of this paper is to determine an FDI-tolerant communication architecture. For this work, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is chosen as communication protocol. TSN is a set of IEEE 802.1 standards and amendments that extend Ethernet for providing deterministic requirements on most of the safety-critical areas. The general applicability of TSN means that multiple mechanisms must be combined in order to address the requirements of an area. Therefore, the determination of an FDI-tolerant TSN-based architecture means to select the sub-set of TSN mechanisms that preserves the determinism even in the presence of faulty traffic. For evaluating the deterministic requirements on different TSN-based architectures, it is used the network simulation tool OM-NeT++ adapted for TSN.

AB  - IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of IEEE standards that extend Ethernet for safety-critical and real-time applications. TSN is envisioned to be widely used in several applications areas, from industrial automation to in-vehicle networking. TSN supports mixed-criticality applications via multiple traffic classes: Time-Triggered (TT) communication, Audio-Video-Bridging (AVB) streams with bounded end-to-end latency as well as Best-Effort messages. TT traffic is scheduled via Gate Control Lists (GCLs) specified for each queue of an egress port. Although researchers have started to propose approaches for the GCL synthesis, all the work so far has ignored lower priority real-time traffic such as AVB, resulting in GCLs that increase the worst-case delays of AVB traffic rendering it unschedulable. In this paper, we propose a GCL synthesis approach based on a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure, which takes into account the AVB traffic, such that both TT and the AVB traffic are schedulable. Our approach is evaluated on several test cases.

AB  - Possible evolution of Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) are currently investigated. Such network should support existing time-constrained avionics flows, as well as new best effort traffic, requiring scheduling algorithms to meet guarantees on avionics flows. Following the current trend of the automotive industry to move toward Audio/Video Bridging (AVB), this paper evaluates an application of the scheduling scheme described in the emerging IEEE 802.1 AVB standard in an avionics switched Ethernet scenario. Results are compared to other common scheduling strategies such as strict priority queuing, and different fair scheduling variants.

AB  - Wireless control applications will play a fundamental role in future factory environments to enable novel mobility use cases and achieve the desired flexibility in production. The standardized integration of 5G into a time-sensitive networking (TSN) environment defines the joint architecture and communication interfaces between the different networks to support time-critical applications. Managing and scheduling such a network in an end-to-end fashion to guarantee the stringent QoS requirements is however a complex task. In this work, we present an efficient window-based resource allocation method for the end-to-end network. A big challenge in scheduling periodic and time-critical control applications over a wireless system is the uncertainty of the channel. We hence introduce a fading correlation-aware optimization to find robust schedules. Our simulation study shows that this approach is able to reduce peak resource demands and hence improve the schedulability compared to standard channel-unaware TSN scheduling.

AB  - Motivated by new use cases such as industrial automation and in-vehicle communication, Time-Sensitive Networking is further improving the layer 2 standards for real-time communication in Ethernet networks. As periodic traffic is a common requirement in such scenarios, the Time Aware Shaper (TAS) is a highly popular mechanism that allows the realization of real-time guarantees in synchronized networks. Most applications in literature suggest to configure the TAS for full stream isolation such that the lowest delays can be achieved. However, this “zero-queuing” strategy requires a high amount of computational resources and time, as the configuration of the gate control lists of each port is a complex task, which is not suitable for scenarios with dynamically changing requirements. This paper presents a novel approach with shared time windows. In combination with stream reservation techniques that are commonly applied for asynchronous mechanisms, the network is able to accept new streams during operation without complex reconfiguration, while still benefiting from some degree of isolation compared to conventional asynchronous shapers. The evaluation shows that, given the right circumstances, the number of accepted real-time streams can be improved significantly.

AB  - As the requirements of real-time networking increase, the IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group is working on new standards for high bandwidth and low latency Ethernet switching. In particular, the upcoming P802.1Qcr standard features Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS), which is a promising approach for real-time networks with high dynamics and critical safety requirements. Additionally, parallel concepts such as frame preemption can be used to reduce delays even further. This work presents a discrete event simulation framework that can analyze the performance of these concepts. It implements frame preemption and multiple shaping algorithms, while recording latency and queue utilization statistics at the switches. In addition, an evaluation of a linear topology with four switches is performed under high link utilization, which demonstrates the benefit of the above mechanisms compared to regular Ethernet switching.

AB  - Recent developments in the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) group have put forth a number of mechanisms to improve deterministic latency in layer 2 switches. Their shaping approaches differ with respect to prerequisites, flexibility, maximum latency, and latency variation (jitter). Asynchronous solutions provide flexibility in dynamic scenarios, but Credit-Based Shaping (CBS) and Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) come with a high latency variance, as the minimum latency is not affected by them. Some applications in industrial and automotive use cases require low jitter while trying to avoid a dependency on time synchronization, and even TSN's redundancy mechanism benefits from a lower latency variance. This work is bridging the gap between low-jitter transmission requirements and asynchronous shaping mechanisms. In this paper, the application of a stateless Asynchronous Constant Delay Shaper (ACDS) is discussed. It collects the queuing duration from the previous bridge to delay each frame for the remaining time such that a constant per-hop delay for each frame is achieved. The discussion includes the prerequisites, the mechanism itself, and its technical complexity, as well as a formal analysis of its guaranteed latency by proving its relation to a token-bucket based ATS. Further, two extensions are discussed, and an evaluation shows the applicability of ACDS by comparing its jitter to ATS in a frame-level simulation.

AB  - Recent developments in industrial automation and in-vehicle communication have raised the requirements of real-time networking. Bus systems that were traditionally deployed in these fields cannot provide sufficient bandwidth and are now shifting towards Ethernet for their real-time communication needs. In this field, standardization efforts from the IEEE and the IETF have developed new data plane mechanisms such as shapers and schedulers, as well as control plane mechanisms such as reservation protocols to support their new requirements. However, their implementation and their optimal configuration remain an important factor for their efficiency. This work presents a machine learning framework that takes on the configuration task. Four different models are trained for the configuration of per-hop latency guarantees in a distributed resource reservation process and compared with respect to their real-time traffic capacity. The evaluation shows that all models provide good configurations for the provided scenarios, but more importantly, they represent a first step for a semi-automated configuration of parameters in Time-Sensitive Networking.

AB  - The IEEE 802.1 Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group is devoted to improving deterministic delay during data communication. To schedule traffic in TSN, Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) has been introduced to guarantee bounded maximum delays without complicated time synchronization, and Urgency Based Scheduler (UBS) becomes the default implementation for ATS. However, due to the traffic fluctuation, UBS cannot achieve best delay bounds if some parameters are not configured appropriately in real time. What is more, UBS needs to consumes excessive butter resources, which prevents TSN from being deployed in real world. To solve these problems, we propose Time Sensitive Queuing (TSQ), a novel ATS mechanism. TSQ lowers the difficulty of TSN deployment by removing the parameter that need to be configured in real time. In addition, to reduce the butter consumption, TSQ applies time-slot-based packet allocation mechanism as the enqueue strategy, and time-slot-based packet polling mechanism as the dequeue strategy, respectively. Our Network Calculus analysis shows that TSQ can provide bounded delays and up to 40% butter resource reduction compared to UBS. The extensive experiments implemented in ns-3 show that TSQ consumes 33% less butter resource compared to UBS.

AB  - To analyze the upper bound of end-to-end delay in time-sensitive networks, an improved calculation model of end-to-end transmission delay based on network calculus is derived according to the relevant knowledge of deterministic network calculus. The effects of GCL gate opening time, scheduling period, the overlap of transmission Windows, and different priorities of traffic on the delay index were analyzed experimentally, and the end-to-end worst-case transmission delay of time triggered (TT) traffic in the whole process of traffic transmission was calculated. Finally, through comprehensive analysis of GCL and reasonable configuration of parameters, good transmission capacity of the communication network is ensured, which provides a theoretical basis for efficient deployment of the communication network and optimal allocation of network resources.

AB  - There are quite tight timing requirements in deterministic low latency network. The IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group has proposed several traffic shapers to satisfy real-time communications requirements. Traditionally, the performance of TSN is analyzed by simulations, whereas these methods cannot cover all corner cases. This paper firstly presented formal models of the TSN’s time-aware and peristaltic shapers using UPPAAL, tactically solving the problem mentioned above. Afterward, we verified some properties of the shapers models, of which the results could evaluate whether these shapers are able to satisfy strict timing requirements or not. Based on the models, we can discuss about the performance of time-critical traffic combining the preemption mechanism. More-over, we can also analyze resource utilization and transmission latency. Under the time properties analysis and verification of TSN traffic shapers, we can provide engineers with an accessible reference that may assist them in developing the TSN.

AB  - Large complex industrial Distributed Control Systems (DCS), e.g., power distribution systems, are expected to function for long time, up to 40 years. Therefore, besides having a long system verification phase for all subsystems, the design phase should consider various aspects when it comes to selection of which technologies to utilize when implementing such systems. In this paper, we study and investigate key challenges of using the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) technology when it comes to design, maintenance and evolution of long life-span complex DCS. We also identify issues and challenges, and propose mitigation strategies for using the TSN technology in long-life system design. Our investigation and analysis shows that many of the TSN standards are in their evolution phase and may as a consequence be subject to different interpretations and implementations. Therefore, achieving a full capacity of using the TSN technology may not be possible, in particular when it comes to design of systems having an expected long life.

AB  - Many industrial players are currently challenged in building distributed CPS and IoT applications with stringent end-to-end QoS requirements. Examples are Vehicle-to-X applications, Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) or functionalities in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Currently, there is no comprehensive solution allowing to efficiently program, deploy, and operate such distributed applications. This paper will focus on real-time concerns, in building distributed CPS and IoT systems. Thereby, the focus lies, on the one hand, on mechanisms required inside of the IoT (compute) nodes, and, on the other hand, on communication protocols such as TSN and 5G connecting them. In the authors' view, the required building blocks for a first end-to-end technology stack are available. However, their integration into a holistic framework is missing.

AB  - Most of the recent researches related to hybrid traffic scheduling in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) focus on how to ensure bounded low-delay transmission for Scheduled Traffic (ST) and Stream Reservation (SR) traffic. However, if high-priority traffic blocks Best Effort (BE) traffic represented by data logging and periodic software updates for a long time, the end-to-end delay of BE messages will be too large. To reduce the blocking of SR traffic on BE traffic by reducing the reserved bandwidth for SR traffic, this paper proposes a traffic scheduling algorithm combined with ingress shaping. First, add ingress buffers before SR queues. Then, schedule SR traffic on a per-flow basis in the TSN switch by limiting the rate at which frames in each ingress buffer enter the SR queue. Finally, joint egress shaping and ingress shaping to reserve bandwidth resources that match its delay requirement for each SR flow. Simulation results show that the maximum end-to-end delay of BE messages can be reduced by 0.32%~17.19%.

AB  - TSN, or Time-Sensitive Network, is a set of standards that allows an Ethernet network to be extended to serve real-time applications while ensuring safety-critical hardware delivery. TSN uses a variety of shaping and scheduling techniques, like Credit-Based Shaping, Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS), Burst-Limiting Shaper (BLS), and Time Aware Shaper (TAS), to improve real-time guarantees. In modern industries, the increasing number of traffic and data are causing the latency to increase significantly. To minimize the end-to-end delay, it is highly required to have lossless compress data. This paper proposes some pre-existing lossless compression algorithms (Huffman, LZW, RLE), which are well suited for the TSN network. It can improve the end-to-end delay despite increasing data and is applicable for the worst-case scenarios. So, the focus of this research is confined to CBS and CBS+TAS shaping mechanism. For the validation of our statement, we have simulated various traffics such as Control Data Traffic (CDT), Audio & Video Bridging (AVB) class A, AVB class B and best-effort by OMNeT++. Comparisons are shown in terms of end-to-end delay between the compressed and uncompressed data and end-to-end delay have been improved for all classes.

AB  - TSN or Time-Sensitive Network is an aggregation of standards that can include the Ethernet extension to support the real-time application while preserving the safety-critical distribution with the hardware. To improve real-time guarantees establishes multiple shaping such as Credit-Based Shaping (CBS), Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS), Burst Limiting Shaping (BLS) and scheduling processes like Time Aware Shaping (TAS) and various traffic are incorporated. In industrial applications, CBS and TAS combination are widely used. Due to increase of number of traffic in modern industries, control data traffic (CDT), are frequently transfer of the system as a consequence AVB credit are freeze very often and behavior of credit of AVB and timing are continuous changing. Analyzing of the behavior of AVB credit for different timing conditions, it can be predicted total traffic condition of different flows and optimistic shaping mechanism of CBS can enhance quality of service. Several optimal cases have been studied.

AB  - Flow control is of particular importance in TimeSensitive Networking (TSN), where timeliness of messages is guaranteed through several types of traffic shaping. This has given rise to a number of papers discussing the worst-case response time analysis of, in particular, the credit-based traffic shaping approach. In this work-in-progress paper, we concern ourselves with the possibility that traffic shaping can be applied in different layers of the protocol stack, e.g., the physical layer and link layer, which may give rise to different credit behaviors. We convey our concern that the analysis performed in literature seems to assume application of traffic shaping in the physical layer, and that the analysis therefore cannot be readily used in a context where shaping is applied in a higher layer. In particular, assuming application of credit-based shaping in the link layer, there are different interpretations possible for credit behavior. Depending on the interpretation, some of the basic properties of credit, that are crucial for the analysis, may no longer be valid after overhead is added by the physical layer. As an ongoing effort, we plan to revisit the eligible interval analysis of [1] with an adaptation for a link layer interpretation of the standard concerning application of traffic shaping.

AB  - End-to-end low-latency deterministic communication, next to high-reliability communication, is one of the key features that communication systems are expected to provide for industrial systems. To achieve time-sensitive networking (TSN), a set of standards have already been designed and deployed for wired industrial communication systems, coexisting or replacing other long-living technologies such as Fieldbus, Profibus, or Modbus. Wireless time-sensitive networking (W-TSN) is getting traction with the development of the newest WiFi generation (IEEE 802.11be) as well as advances in cellular networking. One of the challenges in W-TSN is scheduling and isolation of time-critical traffic in the shared wireless medium. In this paper we present a solution, called dynamic traffic classification, to give faster dedicated access to the wireless medium for packets of highly-time-sensitive flows, that can be generated randomly. Dynamic traffic classification utilizes so-called shadow queues implemented in FPGA-based WiFi baseband SDR platform, openwifi, to prioritize channel access of certain packets over others. We show that the channel access latency in the case of dynamic traffic classification does not depend on the scheduling cycle, but on the distribution of dedicated time slots inside the schedule cycle. As such we achieve to decrease the end-to-end latency by 75% in case of longer communication cycles with wider space between communication time slots.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has been considered the most promising network paradigm for time-critical applications (e.g., industrial control) and traffic scheduling is the core of TSN to ensure low latency and determinism. With the demand for flexible production increases, industrial network topologies and settings change frequently due to pipeline switches. As a result, there is a pressing need for a more efficient TSN scheduling algorithm. In this paper, we propose DeepScheduler, a fast and scalable flow-aware TSN scheduler based on deep reinforcement learning. In contrast to prior work that heavily relies on expert knowledge or problem-specific assumptions, DeepScheduler automatically learns effective scheduling policies from the complex dependency among data flows. We design a scalable neural network architecture that can process arbitrary network topologies with informative representations of the problem, and decompose the problem decision space for efficient model training. In addition, we develop a suite of TSN-compatible testbeds with hardware-software co-design and DeepScheduler integration. Extensive experiments on both simulation and physical testbeds show that DeepScheduler runs >150/5 times faster and improves the schedulability by 36%/39% compared to state-of-the-art heuristic/expert-based methods. With both efficiency and effectiveness, DeepScheduler makes scheduling no longer an obstacle towards flexible manufacturing.

AB  - The frame preemption mechanism in Time-Sensitive Networking can effectively improve the transmission latency performance of express frames. However, in different network operating environments, express frame latency presents complex dynamic characteristics. In response to the complexity of express frame latency characteristics under frame preemption conditions, this article first analyzes the operation principle of the frame preemption mechanism and provides a calculation method for the latency of express frames. Then, considering the impact of link utilization and preemptable frame length on the average latency of express frames, we design a simulation analysis algorithm for the latency characteristics of express frames. Finally, using the proposed algorithm, we analyze the average latency, latency randomness, jitter, and latency boundary characteristics of express frames. The research results are valuable for engineering reference for the effective application of the TSN network frame preemption mechanism.

AB  - The upcoming IEEE Time Sensitive Networking standard will offer a set of new functionality for Ethernet like frame preemption and frame replication that need careful evaluation. The IETF DetNet working group also works on deterministic layer 3 segments and leverages therefore works from the IEEE group. We present here a simulation framework based on OMNeT++ that implements all non time-based features present in TSN in a modular and easily extendable way. The framework gives other researches a stable base to start evaluating existing and future scenarios. An evaluation of frame preemption as well as per-stream policing based on the framework is presented. It was shown, that frame preemption does not always bring latency advantages and highly depends on configuration of the system. The paper concludes with an overview of the computational cost for the use of this framework.

AB  - Ethernet is a key technology to satisfy the communication requirements of future automotive embedded systems. Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) Ethernet is a set of IEEE standards that allows synchronous and time-sensitive communication. It is the favored candidate for backbone and camera applications, but is not expected to replace Controller Area Network (CAN). Instead, both have to coexist in future architectures. No research has been conducted regarding CAN to AVB gateways, and approaches for similar protocols are either not fit or inefficient. In this paper, we present a CAN to AVB Ethernet gateway that allows efficient, real-time capable forwarding. We aggregate and schedule multiple CAN frames into a single AVB Ethernet frame to minimize bandwidth requirements. We evaluate static and dynamic scheduling approaches and determine optimal gateway configurations, showing that the necessary bandwidth reservation is reduced by 72% compared to similar approaches.

AB  - Communication requirements in automotive electronics are steadily increasing. To satisfy this demand and enable future automotive embedded architectures, new interconnect technologies are needed. Audio Video Bridging (AVB) Ethernet is a promising candidate to accomplish this as it features timesensitive and synchronous communication in combination with high bit rates. However, there is a lack of commercial products as well as research regarding AVB-capable system-on-chips (SoCs). In this paper, we investigate how and at what cost a legacy Ethernet MAC can be enhanced into an AVB Ethernet controller. Using FPGA prototyping and a real system based on an ARM Cortex-A9 SoC running Linux, we conducted a series of experiments to evaluate important performance metrics and to validate our design decisions. We achieved frame release latencies of less than 6 μs and time-synchronization with an endpoint-induced inaccuracy of up to 8 μs.

AB  - Nowadays, most of cyber-physical systems in avionics, automotive or recent Industry 4.0 domains require networked communication for mixed-critical applications. Ethernet-based networks such as AFDX, TTEthernet or TSN are capable to support transmission of both safety-critical and non-critical flows. This paper focuses on the TTEthernet network compliant with the avionics ARINC 664-P7 standard supporting time-triggered communication (TT) together with rate-constrained (RC) and best-effort (BE) traffic. Due to a global synchronization, TT communication with low latency and minimal jitter is ensured with static schedules computed offline. For event-triggered RC flows, bounded jitter at the source and end-to-end latency are guaranteed with worst-case analysis methods. With the increasing demands of applications, flows with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements such as video or audio may be transmitted as BE flows. However, on current configurations, no guarantees are offered to BE flows. In this paper, we aim at increasing the maximum RC utilization and improving the QoS of BE flows to allow the transmission of video or audio traffic with low jitter and end-to-end delay requirements. For this, we focus on the scheduling mechanisms and propose a scheduling approach based on a static slotted table that is applied at end systems. This table integrates the TT schedules usually obtained with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) approaches and establishes offsets of RC flows that reduce the end-to-end delay of BE flows. Several strategies for offset computations are proposed based on the distribution of flows locally at end system or globally at switch. We show that local strategies perform better than the global ones to reduce end-to-end delay of BE flows.

AB  - With the continuous evolution of industrial network technology, industrial production has higher and higher requirements for reliability and real-time performance. At present Time Sensitive Networks (TSN) has become one of the evolution directions of the next generation network bearing technology. In TSN, redundancy is usually adopted to meet the reliability requirements of Time-Triggered (TT) flow. However, a large amount of bandwidth consumption caused by redundancy is also inevitable, which will directly affect the schedulability of TT flows. Therefore, this paper proposes a Genetically based Reliable Routing algorithm (GRR) based on Frame Replication and Elimination for Reliability (FRER) standard, which provides reliable and non-overlapping routes for different copies of each TT flow. It not only guarantees the reliability of the TT flow, but also increases its schedulability, so as to meet the needs of industrial applications. Through simulation experiments, compared with the existing methods, the reliability of the proposed reliable routing algorithm is improved by 2.08% on average and the schedulability is improved by 6.3% on average.

AB  - A recent trend in embedded industry is to mix Integrated Modular Architectures (IMA) with Time Sensitive Networking (TSN). IMA principles allow resource sharing between numerous software functions in a deterministic way. On the other side TSN is considered a promising communication solution for distributed architectures. However, TSN has not been fully exploited with IMA, while it would meet the increasing communication needs due to the explosion of the number of on-board software functions. In order to better understand the challenges of designing IMA-TSN systems, this paper proposes a joint model which unifies task and message management and allows evaluation of end-to-end latency properties. The model is illustrated by simulation on an avionic case study.

AB  - This paper presents a schedulability analysis for the Best-Effort (BE) traffic class within Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) networks. The presented analysis considers several features in the TSN standards, including the Credit-Based Shaper (CBS), the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) and the frame preemption. Although the BE class in TSN is primarily used for the traffic with no strict timing requirements, some industrial applications prefer to utilize this class for the non-hard real-time traffic instead of classes that use the CBS. The reason mainly lies in the fact that the complexity of TSN configuration becomes significantly high when the time-triggered traffic via the TAS and other classes via the CBS are used altogether. We demonstrate the applicability of the presented analysis on a vehicular application use case. We show that a network designer can get information on the schedulability of the BE traffic, based on which the network configuration can be further refined with respect to the application requirements.

In this regard, the paper discusses ongoing work and presents preliminary results using a TSN simulator. The results indicate that several parameters of the high priority traffic such as periods, offsets and preemption modes can have a significant impact on the quality of service (e.g., guaranteed message delivery and message delays) of the BE traffic.

AB  - In this paper, we present a bandwidth reservation analysis for Audio-Video Bridging (AVB) traffic in the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards. The proposed analysis is based on the existing worst-case response-time analysis and can be used to calculate the minimum required bandwidth for guaranteeing the schedulability of messages in AVB classes. The proposed analysis allocates per-link bandwidth to AVB traffic that is sufficient to ensure its schedulability when a combination of the Credit-Based Shaper and Time-Aware Shaper mechanisms are used. We evaluate the proposed analysis using an automotive industrial use case. We evaluate the schedulability of AVB traffic by comparing the proposed analysis with the utilization-based bandwidth reservation as recommended by the TSN standards.

Such a model is required as an input to perform end-to-end timing analysis of these systems. Furthermore, we present a methodology that aims at automated extraction of instances of the end-to-end timing model from component-based software architectures of the systems and the TSN network configurations. As a proof of concept, we implement the proposed end-to-end timing model and the extraction methodology in the Rubus Component Model (RCM) and its tool chain Rubus-ICE that are used in the vehicle industry. We demonstrate the usability of the proposed model and methodology by modeling a vehicular industrial use case and performing its timing analysis.

To address this challenge, this paper presents a systematic method to extract this information from vehicular software architectures that can be distributed over several electronic control units connected by Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) networks. As a proof of concept, the proposed extraction method is applied to an industrial component model, namely the Rubus Component Model (RCM), and its toolchain. Furthermore, the usability of the proposed method is demonstrated in an industrial use case from the vehicular domain.

AB  - Designing and simulating large networks, based on the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards, require complex and demanding configuration at the design and pre-simulation phases. Existing configuration and simulation frameworks support only manual configuration of TSN networks. This hampers the applicability of these frameworks to large-sized TSN networks, especially in complex industrial embedded system applications. This paper proposes a modular framework to automate offline scheduling in TSN networks to facilitate the design-time and pre-simulation automated network configurations as well as interpretation of the simulations. To demonstrate and evaluate the applicability of the proposed framework, a large TSN network is automatically configured and its performance is evaluated by measuring end-to-end delays of time-critical flows in a state-of-the-art simulation framework, namely NeSTiNg.

AB  - The IEEE 802.1Qcr Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) proposed by Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) is a flow control mechanism based on Urgency-based Scheduler (UBS). The ATS aims to reshape flows or traffic per-hop and is still with the update of the draft.In the draft of version 2.0, the ATS algorithm concerns about two parameters cir (Committed Information Rate) and cbs (Committed Burst Size). When an ATS shaper operates in the condition of parameter consistency, i.e. the cir and the cbs have the same values of the ingress flow's rate and burstiness respectively, the burst cascade can be avoided perfectly.On the contrary, we introduced a deterministic Network Calculus (NC) based method to compute the delay bound for an ATS hop with parameter inconsistency, with a concatenation model of this ATS shaper and its upstream Strict Priority Queuing (SPQ) scheduler. Furthermore, we induced a threshold for the cbs parameter corresponding to a certain ingress busrtiness. When the cbs of ATS is not equal to the threshold value, the delay bound of the flows shaped by the shaper will increase. In addition, the results of analysis and case study show that when the cbs of the ATS is changed, the delay bounds of other multiplexing flows will also be affected.

AB  - Recent proposals leverage Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) to achieve precise transmission in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). However, most of the proposals require the information of all time-triggered flows to be known in advance and synthesize the gate control list of each switch offline, making the mechanisms they designed inapplicable to industrial automation scenarios where the devices are changed dynamically and the flows should be scheduled online. In this paper, we propose an online routing and scheduling mechanism of TAS for time-sensitive networks. In order to maximize the number of schedulable flows and reduce bandwidth waste, we devise the variable time slot mechanism and minimize the sending start time of each flow. Based on these mechanisms, a novel incremental routing and scheduling (IRAS) algorithm is designed to achieve per-flow deployment, with a pre-routing algorithm to reduce synthesis time. The evaluations show that the IRAS algorithm approaches 96.5 % of the optimal solution in scheduling 2000 flows, and has a feasible per-flow computational time from sub-seconds to less than ten seconds.

AB  - Recent proposals leverage Cyclic-Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) to achieve bounded-delay transmission for cyclic flows in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). However, the Ping-Pong queue-based model in CQF will introduce the jitter of two cycles, which is inapplicable to industrial automation scenarios where isochronous flows such as synchronized frames and motor control loops require zero jitter.We present TACQ, a first time-aware cyclic-queuing mechanism to support the co-transmission of cyclic flows and isochronous flows. Our key insight is that isochronous flows should enable zero-jitter while minimally impacting the bounded-delay of cyclic flows. To achieve this goal, we design a novel no-wait shaper (NWS) that handles isochronous flows with as little time-slot as possible. For cyclic flows, we extend the CQF to schedule flows with a double-closed state on the Tx-gate and compute the open time on the Rx-gate. Simulation results show that TACQ significantly reduces the delay of isochronous flows by 81.3% and achieves zero jitter compared with CQF. And the NWS effectively schedules 87.2% flows at 500 flows level in feasible execution time.

AB  - The IEEE 802.1Q working group defines the Ethernet time-sensitive networking (TSN) standard to support data-intensive industrial real-time networks. Unfortunately, TSN has the possibility for frame priority inversion that can lead to deadline misses. In this paper, we present a novel approach to address priority inversion in TSN that prioritizes frames during network configuration, determines traffic paths off-line with integer linear programming (ILP), and schedules transmissions on-line using the earliest deadline first (EDF) algorithm. Our approach, the ILP deadline-based TSN (ILP-DTSN), optimizes the network for time-sensitive traffic while minimizing the blocking effects of preemption. ILP-DTSN results in fewer missed deadlines compared with the time-aware shaper (TAS) with one-level preemption while reducing average end-to-end latency by up to 32%.

AB  - The realization of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is awaited. CPS analyzes various real-world sensing data in cyberspace and utilizes the analysis results to control real-world systems. This is expected to revolutionize various fields such as industrial automation and remote vehicle control. These usecases require analysis of large amounts of data and periodic real-time communication. Effective ways to meet these requirements include distributed processing with edge data centers (EdgeDCs) and guaranteed jitter with Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). In EdgeDCs, servers and networks are virtualized and shared by multiple users in a multitenancy architecture, which is beneficial for cost reduction. In such a multitenancy environment, various users can add or remove applications at any time, and the number of applications is expected to change from moment to moment. In contrast, Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), the standard for time-division transmission in TSN, requires network-wide configuration in advance for each application. If TAS is applied in EdgeDCs, network-wide reconfiguration occurs frequently. It takes more time to allocate applications, and configuration traffic increases. Moreover, the traffic classes used in TAS cannot accommodate a large number of applications. In this paper, we propose a flexible TAS scheduling system. Our system does not require reconfiguration of relay devices when applications are added or deleted and enables communicating without depending on the traffic class. We implemented the proposed system into Linux kernel and extension plugins for Kubernetes, which is assumed to be the infrastructure for EdgeDC. We also evaluated bandwidth utilization and the number of reconfigurations through simulations.

AB  - Ethernet is an evolving standard, not a static one. It's a family of frame-based networking technologies and communication services offering different communication capabilities and quality of service to distributed applications. Ethernet is becoming more present in critical embedded systems because of the supporting software and hardware ecosystem, and guaranteed growth path supported by different industries. Ethernet is a mature technology developed for best-effort communication in high-volume and consumer applications, but its properties have imposed limitations on design of fault-tolerant, time-critical, safety-critical and mission-critical systems. As Ethernet services are continuously evolving to cover different applications, modified variants of Ethernet and additional services have been developed to allow its use in low-latency, lossless application in data centers, as well as in embedded critical applications. This paper provides an overview and comparison of existing and ongoing Ethernet developments for design of time-, mission-, and safety-critical systems. It discusses the capabilities of different Ethernet QoS protocol services (among others IEEE AVB/DCB, ARINC 664, TTEthernet/SAE AS6802, and various Real-Time Ethernet modifications) and their applicability in critical embedded systems.

AB  - Schedule scheme is essential for real-time Ethernet. Due to the inevitable change of network configurations, the solution requires to be incrementally scheduled in a timely manner. Solver-based methods are time-consuming, while handcrafted scheduling heuristics require domain knowledge and professional expertise, and their application scenarios are usually limited. Instead of designing heuristic strategy manually, we propose TTDeep, a deep reinforcement learning schedule framework, to incrementally schedule Time-Triggered (TT) flows and adapt to various topologies. Our novel framework includes 3 key designs: a period layer to capture the periodical transmission nature of TT flows, the graph neural network to extract and represent topology features, and a 3-step selection paradigm to alleviate the huge action search space issue. Comprehensive experiments show that TTDeep can schedule TT flows much faster than solver-based methods and schedule nearly twice more TT flows on average compared to handcrafted heuristics.

AB  - As substations become increasingly intelligent, a growing disparity arises between the surge in network traffic and the real-time transmission demands of critical communication services. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) offers the capability to shape, schedule, and synchronize data flows, thereby enhancing the transmission quality of time-critical services. We propose a TSN-based intelligent substation traffic scheduling scheme. The transmission delay boundary of substation messages under TSN is calculated based on network calculus theory. The Omnet++ network simulation platform is used for case analysis. Simulation results reveal that, with static configuration of gate control lists, this traffic scheduling approach ensures ultra-low latency and zero jitter for sampled value message transmissions, while concurrently ensuring real-time transmission for all other communication services.

Time-sensitive Networking (TSN), an extension of the Ethernet, is a set of protocols developed and maintained by the IEEE 802.1 Task Group; the protocols deal with time synchronization, traffic scheduling, and network configuration, etc. TSN yields promising solutions for real-time and deterministic networks. Here, we develop a TSN simulation model based on OMNET++; we model a TSN-enabled switch that schedules traffic using gate control lists (GCLs). Simulation verified that the model guaranteed deterministic end-to-end latency.

AB  - Distributed mixed-criticality system (DMCS) has been widely used in various critical domains such as self-driving cars and space crafts. To guarantee the end-to-end QoS (i.e., deadline/jitter requirements) of sensing-controlling-actuating control loops (CL) applications, DMCS adopts Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), an emerging real-time Ethernet technology, for communication between end systems (ES). TSN provides a synchronized global clock and guarantees bounded delay for time-critical traffic in CLs, making it possible for DMCS to collaboratively schedule the computation (on ES) and communication (in TSN) to meet the Quality of Service (QoS) requirement. However, as modern DMCS tends to use fully-fledged Linux distributions (rather than a custom real-time OS) on ES to enjoy Linux’s mature ecosystem, it is challenging for DMCS to realize TSN-based QoS guarantees because the event-triggered scheduling of Linux on ES is incompatible with TSN.This paper proposes TAsk Scheduling Puppeteer (TASP), a mechanism that schedules CL tasks based on TSN without modifying the Linux OS. The key idea of TASP is to manipulate task scheduling by controlling the timing of CL packet submissions at the interface between TSN and ES. Specifically, TASP extracts two parameters: Fore Guardband (ForeGB) and Back Guardband (BackGB). During the ForeGB period before a CL packet’s submission, TASP forbids any packets’ submission; while during the BackGB period after a CL packet’s submission, TASP forbids any other CL packets’ submission. ForeGB and BackGB can ensure that there is at most one schedulable task on the ES at any time, and thus Linux has no choice but to schedule the only task, making the Linux scheduler a puppet. We have deployed TASP and evaluated it in real-world TSN switches based on an open-source TSN project, OpenTSN. The TASP-enabled ES can achieve task scheduling precisely based on TSN’s global clock, which outperforms the original ES by reducing end-to-end jitter from milliseconds to microseconds.

AB  - With the expansion of Internet application fields, traditional Ethernet cannot meet the real-time and deterministic requirements of time- and delay-sensitive applications. In order to solve this problem, the IEEE time-sensitive network group proposes a variety of Traffic shaping mechanisms. Among them, Asynchronous Traffic Shaper (ATS) scheduling can provide high link utilization and deterministic delay guarantee in the case of multiple traffic mixing in the network. And there is no need for strict clock synchronization between network devices. In order to solve the calculation problem of the ATS scheduling mechanism, this paper completes the theoretical delay upper bound calculation tool for flows with an ATS mechanism based on the delay analysis model in the Urgency-Based Scheduler (UBS).

AB  - Background: The communication architecture within an aircraft needs to support high speed data requirements with reduced wiring weight. With Time Sensitive Networking, we can have multiple gateways and interfaces for each subsystem, which substantially reduces point to point communication. Methods: In this study, we have used a System Level Modelling Tool called VisualSim Architect for evaluating various use cases and validating the results. Results: By using Ethernet as the backbone helped in providing very high bandwidth for critical and non-critical applications. By applying Time Sensitive Networking protocols, a deterministic behavior for time critical applications were observed. Further, it was found that by adding AI algorithms to shape the traffic and time slots increased the reliability. Conclusion: From the results of various use cases, it was seen that even with Time Sensitive Networking, few of the critical applications misses their time slot and as a result a spike in latency plots were observed. In order to prevent slot misses, dynamic time slot configuration as well as credit configuration with the help of AI algorithms were considered and the results obtained helped validate this statement.

AB  - In many emerging Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) applications such as industrial control and automotive, periodic traffic with end-to-end latency constraints is buffered with nonmission-critical aperiodic traffic. As queueing delay is a central component of end-to-end latency, we study the effect of aperiodic traffic on the queueing delay of periodic traffic via characterizing the probability distribution of queue size and delay in an (M + D)/M/1 queue, a queue with Poisson and periodic inputs, infinite waiting capacity and a single memoryless server. Since obtaining the closed form distributions of the queue size and delay is intractable, we approximate the behavior of the (M + D)/M/1 queue when the service and arrival rates are close. We use a Markov chain with a quasitoeplitz matrix, enabling us to use an existing technique to study this class of Markov chains. We determine the transition matrix of the Markov chain, investigate the setting in which the approximation works well, and compute the stationary distribution. We plot and compare the stationary distributions of queue size and delay between the (M + D)/M/1 queue and our model; we observe that our model is a favorable match.

AB  - With Audio and Video Bridging (AVB), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) AVB task group introduced Real-Time capabilities to Ethernet based on IEEE 802 Standards. As AVB was conceived with a focus on home and professional audio and video transmissions, some mandatory aspects for the application in industrial control networks are not covered. Under the name of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), second generation AVB standards are being developed to address the requirements of industrial automation and control networks, and automotive in-vehicle networks. One of the mandatory requirements addressed by TSN is a redundancy feature to achieve fault tolerance. This paper compares two methods for implementing fault-tolerant networks with the stream registration mechanisms that are planned for TSN.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN), which is well known as one of deterministic Ethernet, can ensure a real-time property of time-critical traffic by providing various standards. In particular, IEEE 802.1Qbv, which is one of the standards about TSN, can minimize a problem that occurred due to delay by ensuring the real-time transmission of a message that has high priority through scheduling. However, because scheduling messages in TSN is an NP-hard problem as same as the job schedule in a manufacturing process, an optimal schedule is needed to solve the problem. This study proposed a method to optimize a time-critical traffic schedule in TSN using a genetic algorithm. A chromosome in the genetic algorithm consists of messages to be scheduled, and schedules are created by the order of messages arranged in a chromosome. The performance of the chromosome is evaluated through the fitness function, which uses three performance indicators (end-to-end delay, jitter, and bandwidth utilization for guard band) as parameters. Finally, the proposed schedule optimization algorithm was performed over a simulation environment that simulated a real autonomous driving vehicle network to verify the applicability.

AB  - In-vehicle networks are increasingly using complex functions to enhance user convenience. This has led to a rise in both the number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and the bandwidth between data traffic. Ethernet communication has been adopted to address this issue in a network where multimedia and control traffic coexists. However, a solution was still required to maintain Quality-of-Service (QoS), which led to the emergence of the Time-Sensitive Network (TSN). In this situation, TSN, which defines rules for real-time, reliability, etc., is gaining attention. In this paper, we compare the performance of Time Aware Shaper (TAS) and frame preemption methods for real-time scheduling among TSN protocols. Furthermore, we propose a method to enhance QoS by predicting overhead and flexibly selecting preemption size.

AB  - To enable bandwidth-efficient temporal isolation of time critical scheduled traffic, an approach for frame preemption was defined in IEEE 802.3br and 802.1Qbu amendments. However, the proposed solution only offers single-level preemption, which means that low-priority frames can still hinder transmission of other, possibly more important frames. In this paper, we discuss implementation aspects of multi-level frame preemption paradigm, an extension of the original mechanism, aimed at providing an opportunity for frames with firm timing requirements, yet not qualified as scheduled traffic, to benefit from preventing interference caused by low-priority frames. We propose a scalable architecture that is suitable for implementation both on ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) and FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) platforms.

AB  - This paper studies the effect of the precision of the time synchronization on the QoS of Time-Aware Shaping (TAS). TAS is one of the standards defined in IEEE 802.1TSN(Time-Sensitive Networking) and being considered as the priority control for the Ethernet-based in-vehicle networks. Although TAS can control more exactly than other controls by using gates at egress ports, it requires pretty precision of the time synchronization. However, since many in-vehicle devices has no clock for the time synchronization, the time synchronization is not always exact. However, the precision of the time synchronization affects QoS, but it is not clear yet. Therefore, this paper evaluates QoS over in-vehicle networks under scenarios with various lags of the time synchronization by simulation.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a promising solution for the next generation in-vehicle networks. To enable innovations in adaptability, there is a strong trend to integrate TSN with Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Software-defined TSN requires fast routing algorithms that guarantee the Worst-Case End-to-End Delay (WCED) of the Audio Video Bridging (AVB) flows. However, current AVB flow routing algorithms execute WCED analysis for an exponential amount of route candidates, which is not feasible at run-time. Current WCED analysis of the AVB flows depends on the specific flow setup of other traffic classes. When high-priority flows change, low-priority flows must be adjusted as well to maintain deadline guarantees. In this paper, we propose a per-class flow management scheme to enable run-time routing of the AVB flows. Our composable analysis computes a formal WCED bound of the AVB flows. It does not rely on the flow setup of other traffic classes. So, the WCED and routes can be computed for each traffic class independently and in parallel. Based on the analysis, we develop a fast heuristic algorithm to incrementally route the AVB flows with guaranteed deadlines. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to the existing solutions, the composable analysis is 2.6x faster. The cost is that the WCED bound can be up to 31% higher. When given a similar run-time as existing solutions, the proposed routing algorithm can set up 1.6x more flows. The average time to set up one flow is within 0.14s.

AB  - In the automotive domain, Ethernet Audio Video Bridging (AVB) provides service guarantees for real-time traffic. Its configuration synthesis requires routing the flows and allocating the bandwidth for Credit Based Shaping (CBS). Current approaches typically employ deadline-oblivious bandwidth allocation and rely on routing to establish deadline guarantees. But the worst-case delay of AVB flows requires complex analysis. Thus, routing integrated with the delay analysis either supports limited Stream Reservation (SR) classes or suffers significant timing overhead. To enable efficient run-time flow setup, we propose SynAVB, a tool to synthesize the configuration of Ethernet AVB, which establishes deadline awareness in bandwidth allocation. SynAVB supports an arbitrary number of SR classes and processes them one by one. For the flows in an SR class, it first performs a deadline-oblivious routing based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to guarantee the necessary bandwidth required by the flows. Then, a deadline-aware slope allocation algorithm computes the bandwidth required on every link to satisfy the deadline of all flows. Our experiment demonstrates that, given the same routes, the deadline-aware bandwidth allocation results in fewer flows violating the deadline compared with other allocation strategies. Moreover, SynAVB can guarantee the deadline of more flows while its run-time is up to 14.3x faster than the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB  - We propose a Software-Defined Network (SDN)based approach for ultra-fast recovery of Time Sensitive Networks (TSN) in the case of failure events. We exploit the Source Routing paradigm for explicit path control and the creation of a stateless TSN data plane. We further propose a TSN failure recovery routing heuristic used to minimise link congestion, while we also introduce the concept of TSN subgraphs to quickly reschedule the flows traversing the problematic area. We evaluate our approach using SDN-based Source Routing and Linux-based TSN scheduling integrated into Mininet.

AB  - Owing to Ethernet's low cost, high bandwidth and architecture openness, much attention has been paid to develop converged Ethernet to support both time-critical services and conventional communication services on a unified network infrastructure. The greatest challenge here is providing low and deterministic latency for time-critical packets. Recently, the IEEE time sensitive networking task group is launched to address it. However, their framework is complex and unsuitable for commodity switch architecture. In this paper, we propose a concise and efficient converged real-time Ethernet framework called XpressEth, which leverages Dual Preemption mechanism to minimize the delay of time-critical packets, and employs a lightweight Slot Assignment Scheduler to minimize the conflicts among time-critical packets at sources. XpressEth cuts off great burden from both forwarding and scheduling. The simulation results verify that XpressEth can provide ultra-low and deterministic latency for time-critical packets (1.024μ s per hop and zero jitter in 1Gbps network), which is 13× better than time sensitive networking solution, and the side-effect on conventional communication traffic is negligible.

AB  - Distributed real-time systems often rely on time-triggered communication and task execution to guarantee end-to-end latency and time-predictable computation. Such systems require a reliable synchronized network time to be shared among end-systems. The IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) enables such clock synchronization throughout an Ethernet-based network. While security was not addressed in previous versions of the IEEE 1588 standard, in its most recent iteration (IEEE 1588-2019), several security mechanisms and recommendations were included describing different measures that can be taken to improve system security and safety. One proposal to improve security and reliability is to add redundancy to the network through modifications in the topology. However, this recommendation omits implementation details and leaves the question open of how it affects synchronization quality. This work investigates the quality impact and security properties of redundant PTP deployment and proposes an observation window-based multi-domain, PTP end-system, design to increase fault-tolerance and security. We implement the proposed design inside a discrete-event network simulator and evaluate its clock synchronization quality using two test-case network topologies with simulated faults.

AB  - Many time-sensitive networked systems, such as networked control systems or other cyber/physical systems, require well-defined Quality of Service (QoS) with guaranteed deterministic bounds on network delay. Existing QoS models typically provide no guarantees for excess traffic beyond the traffic specified during the initial admission process. This can lead to a waste of resources when applications overcompensate during resource reservation to avoid traffic violations. In this work, we propose the Dynamic Priority Token Bucket (DPTB), a fundamentally different new QoS model. DPTB permits short-time violations without immediately dropping to best-effort guarantees for excess traffic. Instead, the priority of the application gets degraded to weaker but still deterministic guarantees. At any point in time, the application can calculate the currently guaranteed delay bounds, which depend only on its own past sending behavior, to enable application-level adaptation of the sending rate and application-side prediction of the implications onto the application performance. We designed DPTB as a token bucket extension that can be used on top of several existing scheduling mechanisms, such as the Asynchronous Traffic Shaper of IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). Our evaluations show that DPTB is more resilient to bursty cross-traffic, resulting in significantly lower average delays than regular reservations.

AB  - This paper analyzes cooperative diversity wireless networks with the application of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques, using amplify-and-forward (AF) MIMO relaying with transmit antenna selection (TAS)/maximal-ratio combing (MRC) and relay selection (RS). The source, destination, and relays are equipped with multiple antennas, denoted by NS, ND, and NR, respectively. Specifically, the asymptotic performance is analyzed and the derived upper bound and lower bound on the diversity order leads to the conclusion that the diversity order of NSND +NRmin{NS;ND} can be achieved in the cooperative AF MIMO relaying scenario, which depends on the total number of relay antennas rather than the individual number of each relay's antennas. Numerical results that confirm our analysis are also presented in the paper.

AB  - This work explores a network architecture that combines the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm with a partitioning system for real-time networks based on the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards. The aim of the addressed architecture is to enforce temporal isolation for the flows already foreseen at the network design time, so that their delays are not affected by the introduction of new flows in the network at run time. The work describes the design of the proposed architecture and presents a preliminary experimental assessment obtained over commercial-off-the-shelf TSN-compliant switches.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is appealing to Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) due to its support for deterministic real-time communication based on Ethernet. The deterministic transmission of time-sensitive traffic is achieved through a time-triggered mechanism, which requires precise schedule synthesis. However, existing approaches mostly focus on the static schedule, which cannot guarantee rapid response to dynamic requirements due to long runtime. Moreover, the multicast scheduling problem required for distributed applications in IIoT has been ignored. In this paper, we formulate the joint routing and scheduling problem for multicast time-sensitive traffic based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and extend it to cluster-ILP (CILP) to accelerate schedule synthesis. Firstly, an improved topology pruning is introduced to reduce the scale of the scheduling problem. Then flows are divided into several groups and schedules are calculated for flows in different groups incrementally. The evaluation results indicate that our proposed algorithm can reduce the runtime by 86.7% on average while ensuring the performance of resource utilization, thus increasing the schedulability for dynamic applications in TSN.

AB  - The Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) network systems confront bandwidth resource sharing challenge constantly, with the objective to obey strict timing requirements. In traditional avionics network, the deterministic QoS guarantees are maintained by precise offline configuration during the design period. However, considering the increasing flexibility and variable scale of avionics systems in recent years, it is inevitable to develop a new network framework that can adapt to scalability. Thus, a Software Defined Networking (SDN)-based avionics network is explored to reduce the complexity and integration overheads for upgrading, which must meet bandwidth and end-to-end latency requirements both. SDN possesses the advantages with global visibility and flexibility management of flows for safety critical applications, but it could not support real-time guarantee for traffic transmission in the network. Nevertheless, the centralized SDN can be an effective implement to combine SDN and bandwidth resource allocation for Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) in avionics network. And it is revealed that the Time Aware Shaper (TAS) and Credit Based Shaper (CBS) play key roles in bandwidth allocation for TSN to obtain deterministic traffic transmission behaviors, which also shows great interests to automotive and industrial communications. In this paper, we first propose a SDN-based framework for traffic bandwidth allocation in avionics network, which can significantly enhance bandwidth reservation management during real-time network communication. Then, we introduce a heuristic algorithm to resolve traffic bandwidth allocation problem, and derive multiple scheduling constraints to support traffic transmission with low and bounded latency and further ensure safety-critical communication. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate our method, and we also discuss trade-offs to optimize the required calculation time, thus can be flexible adopted in safety-critical and time-sensitive applications.

AB  - Recent studies leverage time-aware shaper (TAS) and frame replication and elimination for reliability (FRER) techniques to achieve deterministic latency and high reliability for time-triggered (TT) flows. FRER requires transmitting TT flows on $k$ disjoint paths to tolerate transient and permanent failures. However, directly allocating timeslot resources for all $k$ TT flows will dramatically increase the computational complexity of gate control lists (GCLs), seriously impair scheduling capabilities, and result in a wastage of bandwidth. In this paper, we propose an ultra-reliable time-aware shaper (uTAS). uTAS only allocates timeslots for one TT flow to ensure deterministic transmission. The $k - 1$ replica TT (RT) flows are delivered using a best-effort strategy. On this basis, we propose an adaptive window scheduling (AWS) algorithm based on network calculus, which aims to guarantee that RT flows reach their destinations within the deadline. Evaluation results show that uTAS can meet the flow reliability and deadline requirements. Compared to directly combining TAS and FRER (DCTF), uTAS reduces the total number of GCLs by approximately 72.9%.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is an emerging solution for deterministic transmission of time-sensitive services in wired/Ethernet and wireless networks and is considered to be the next generation of Ethernet. Due to the dynamic nature in its physical layer, wireless communications in general and wireless TSN (WTSN) in particular face more technical challenges than wired transmission. This paper proposes a wireless dynamic flow scheduling algorithm that is coined as PA-WTSN and deals with joint power and resource allocation based on OFDMA channel access. The algorithm is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem with time sensitivity constraints and consideration of power allocation which is necessary for time-varying wireless channels. With the proposed algorithm, the end-to-end delay is optimized. and the effectiveness of the algorithm is validated by simulation.

AB  - With the rapid development of industrial automation, higher requirements are put forward for reliable and deterministic communication in industrial networks. And time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a promising technology that can satisfy such deterministic transmission requirements. Currently, TSN typically uses the shortest path routing (SPR) algorithm to determine the transmission path of traffic. However, the SPR algorithm may cause a high load on a single path, which makes it difficult to improve the schedulability and determinism of time-triggered (TT) traffic. In this paper, a TSN traffic scheduling method based on Q-learning routing optimization for TT traffic is proposed, and the transmission performance of the proposed method is tested. The results show that the delay and jitter of TT traffic are reduced after using this method.

AB  - As the global industrial upgrading requires higher reliability and real-time performance of data communication, Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) has been widely studied. Al-though many TSN scheduling algorithms are designed, there is no standardized analysis report after scheduling and comprehensive scheduling performance evaluation. This paper presents a complete automatic report generation system to analyze the scheduling performance. To standardize various data in TSN-based manufacturing, a uniform auto-generated report model is defined based on the Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA). A learning-based performance evaluation (LPE) method is established to comprehensively analyze the performance of TSN scheduling. In LPE, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and entropy weight method (EWM) is adopted to optimize the weight distribution of performance indexes objectively, and convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to get the final evaluation result rapidly. Compared with the previous evaluation methods, simulations show the training time of the evaluation method is significantly reduced.

AB  - Because of the advantages of high bandwidth, low cost, and architecture openness, Ethernet is increasingly used in the industrial Internet to support both time-critical services and conventional communication services on a unified network infrastructure. The biggest challenge right now is to provide low and deterministic latency for time-critical services. Preemption is an effective way to achieve deterministic and low latency. However, the current preemption mechanism has no specific hardware implementation, nor does it describe the restoration after preemption. In this paper, we implement preemption mechanism in hardware and propose two preemption restoration mechanisms: Preemption Restart and Preemption Resume, they are suitable for different scenarios. We also discussed all the details implemented on common commercial switch architectures. Finally, we implement preemption restoration and verify our design in the actual vehicle network topology. Through experiments, we verify the necessity of the preemption mechanism and evaluate the impact of preemption restoration on non-time-critical services.

AB  - The traditional in-vehicle network is changing due to the increasing number of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and the bandwidth demand of future applications. Instead of using MOST for multimedia applications, there are some efforts of the automotive OEMs to introduce Ethernet for these applications. The legacy switched Ethernet network is not able to provide guaranteed Quality-of-Service (QoS) so that information can be delayed or lost in certain situations. With the introduction of the IEEE 802.1 Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) specification, low latency multimedia streaming services with guaranteed QoS are possible in a switched Ethernet network. In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of the Ethernet AVB standard for the use in a vehicle by comparing the performance to a prioritized network based on IEEE 802.1Q. We consider different invehicle applications and determine how the background load will influence these applications. Scope of the work is to reveal the benefits and weakness of Ethernet AVB compared to the legacy prioritization mechanism specified in IEEE 802.1Q.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is considered to be an important means to achieve deterministic low-latency transmission, and traffic scheduling and routing are the keys to deterministic transmission. In this paper we first formulate the routing and scheduling joint optimization problem in TSN networks, where the schedulability of all data flows in the network is minimized by optimizing the transmission time slots of each data flow while considering routing. The optimal routing scheme is first determined using a heuristic algorithm, and then the scheduling scheme for each data stream is determined based on the constraints. To further optimize the schedulability ratio, the scheduling order among data flows is optimized using the Genetic Algorithm (GA). Simulation results show that compared with the traditional algorithms, the proposed algorithm has a higher schedulability and shorter running time even when the network size increases gradually.

AB  - The amount of traffics is increasing rapidly due to the increase of the number of electronic components and vehicle applications in vehicles. They require more network bandwidth and more stringent end-to-end latency and jitter constraints. In this situation, IEEE Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) is expected to be a promising technology in In-Vehicle Network since it guarantees high level of Quality of Service (QoS) for real-time communication. AVB defined tow SR-Classes for time sensitive traffics. However, as a result of the complexity of stream reservation domain construction, in-vehicle networks tend to use single traffic classes. In addition, the AVB jitter constraint is too weak. In this paper, an improved Ethernet AVB model with single SR-Class and time-triggered scheduling is proposed. In this model, time-sensitive traffics with high jitter requirements are forwarded through time-triggered scheduling, and ordinary time-sensitive flows are forwarded using SR-Class. Through simulations we confirm that proposed model not only satisfies the Qos requirements, but also has some extra advantages.

AB  - With the interconnection of distributed devices from different industrial automation networks, heterogeneous traffics with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements increase dramatically. Shapers in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) enable the coexistence of different industrial traffics within a single network infrastructure. In this paper, with full consideration of the time-criticality of different industrial traffics and shaping mechanisms, we propose a network calculus-based modeling scheme for the widely-used Credit Based Shaper (CBS) and Time Aware Shaper (TAS). Then, we analyze the QoS of industrial traffics with different real-time characteristics by CBS and TAS, respectively. To evaluate the accuracy of network calculus-based modeling scheme, we compare our theoretical analysis with simulations, wherein a compactness function is defined to describe QoS compactness. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of proposed modeling scheme, by which we further validate both CBS and TAS can satisfy the QoS of traffics for different industrial automation scenarios.

AB  - Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF, a.k.a IEEE 802.1Qch) has been proposed to satisfy the demands of predictable deterministic latency only related to the number of hops. However, IEEE 802.1Qch only introduces the principle and working mechanism of CQF. There are still many open problems worth exploring to make CQF practical in real dynamic application scenarios. To achieve deterministic end-to-end latency by efficiently allocating the real flows with limited bandwidth resources, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning based joint routing and scheduling algorithm. We transform the CQF into formulated model and orchestrate path in consideration of hardware resources and latency requirements to accommodate more scheduled flows. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve good performance in transmission stability and latency certainty than RIP.

AB  - 5G and Industrial Internet are bringing a variety of applications with on-time and reliable demands. Cyclic queuing and forwarding (CQF), a well-known mechanism defined by IEEE 802.1 Qch in Time Sensitive Network (TSN), achieves deterministic end-to-end latency and jitter without complex gating calculations. However, most of the current work ignores the prevalence of hybrid networks with different link rates, resulting in low bandwidth utilization and high latency for single-cycle CQF. In this paper, we propose a multi-cycle CQF to address the transmission in multi-link-rate networking, reducing deterministic end-to-end latency and improving link bandwidth utilization. In addition, we formulate the scheduling constraints, being of guiding significance for designing the transmission of multi-link-rate networks, and we design an online scheduling algorithm based on it. We compare the proposed scheme with the single-cycle CQF online scheduling algorithm in hierarchical multi-link-rate networking scenarios, and the evaluation shows that our algorithm achieves better end-to-end ultra-low latency (38.9% reduction) with a smaller schedulability gap compared with single-cycle CQF.

AB  - Traditional methods for designing cyber-physical systems (CPS) are mostly based on the best-effort communication to design control and transmission mechanisms independently, which limits the overall system performance. Moreover, these methods focus on the utilization of transmission resources without sufficient consideration of deterministic low latency communication. Hence, the co-design of control and transmission in CPS integrated with Time Sensitive Networking (TSN), that provides deterministic transmission, is a promising and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a co-design method of control and transmission mechanisms by optimizing the sampling rates of control systems with a shared multi-hop TSN. This co-design method is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to minimize the overall control cost while ensuring all data flows to meet their end-to-end deadlines. To solve this MINLP problem with the greatest common divisor (GCD) and bilinear constraints efficiently, we adopt the scaling method and McCormick envelopes to eliminate the non-differentiable and nonlinear terms. Moreover, we design an optimized linearization method to solve the trade-off problem between the algorithm runtime and accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the overall system performance.

Time sensitive network has become an important research content of vehicle Ethernet because of its high-precision synchronization, deterministic delay, redundant communication and other characteristics. This paper proposes an instruction delay time model in vehicle-mounted scenarios, and based on OMNeT++ simulation platform and improved CoRE4INET framework, combined with vehicle-mounted network traffic scenarios, designs network topology and simulation traffic, simulates and analyzes the performance of Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) mechanism, and compares it with Time Aware Shaper (TAS) mechanism. The simulation results show that compared with Time Aware Shaper mechanism, the Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding mechanism has better performance for aperiodic messages in the vehicle-based scenario designed in this paper, and can effectively reduce the end-to-end delay of messages.

However, due to the isolation of the existing OT network and IT network, the requirements of low latency, low jitter, and high reliability for transmission and processing of industrial time-sensitive tasks data traffic in IIoT scenarios with strong dynamic and complex topology face a series of non-trivial challenges. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical computing network collaboration architecture for IIoT based on edge/fog computing. Our architecture is built upon the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) to flexibly support different requirements of large-scale industrial production applications by constructing the hierarchical computing network collaboration domain, combined with an improved Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) scheduling shaper mechanism. We tackle the critical problems of architecture design by presenting three essential components. Moreover, we build and implement our simulation testbed based on Omnet++, and evaluate our design.

AB  - With the advancement of intelligence and networked automotive, the domain-centralized architecture, which employs time sensitive networking (TSN) as the inter-domain backbone network and control area network with flexible data rate (CAN-FD) as the intra-domain network, has garnered significant attention. However, cross-domain end-to-end communication involves multiple components, and significant disparities between TSN and CAN-FD render response time analysis within domain-centralized architecture for mixed-critical traffic exceptionally complex. In this paper, we develop a cross-domain with TSN and CAN-FD end-to-end response time evaluation tool, which analyzes the response time of mixed-critical traffic under different design options segment by segment. We specifically analyze the waiting times of different messages in the domain control unit when faced with the design options of one-to-one and multi-to-one conversion of CAN-FD and TSN frames. The proposed evaluation tool can be easily extended to different design options to support more application scenarios. Theoretical computational analysis and real hardware measurements show the effectiveness of our tool.

AB  - Real-time communication over Ethernet is becoming important in various application areas of cyber-physical systems such as industrial automation and control, avionics, and automotive networking. Since such applications are typically time critical, Ethernet technology has been enhanced to support time-driven communication through the IEEE 802.1 TSN standards. The performance and stability of control applications is strongly impacted by the timing of the network communication. Thus, in order to guarantee stability requirements, when synthesizing the communication schedule and routing, it is needed to consider the degree to which control applications can tolerate message delays and jitters. In this paper we jointly solve the message scheduling and routing problem for networked cyber-physical systems based on the time-triggered Ethernet TSN standards. Moreover, we consider this communication synthesis problem in the context of control applications and guarantee their worst-case stability, taking explicitly into consideration the impact of communication delay and jitter on control quality. Considering the inherent complexity of the network communication synthesis problem, we also propose new heuristics to improve synthesis efficiency without any major loss of quality. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.

AB  - Machine learning (ML), and supervised learning in particular, can be used to learn what makes it hard for a network to be feasible and try to predict whether a network configuration will be feasible without executing a conventional schedulability analysis. A disadvantage of ML-based timing verification with respect to schedulability analysis is the possibility of “false positives”: configurations deemed feasible while they are not. In this work, in order to minimize the rate of false positives, we propose the use of a measure of the uncertainty of the prediction to drop it when the uncertainty is too high, and rely instead on schedulability analysis. In this hybrid verification strategy, the clear-cut decisions are taken by ML, while the more difficult ones are taken by a conventional schedulability analysis. Importantly, the trade-off achieved between prediction accuracy and computing time can be controlled. We apply this hybrid verification method to Ethernet TSN networks and obtain, for instance in the case of priority scheduling with 8 traffic classes, a 99% prediction accuracy with a speedup factor of 5.7 with respect to conventional schedulability analysis and a reduction of 46% of the false positives compared to ML alone.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of standards that enables the industry to provide real-time guarantees for time-critical communications with Ethernet hardware. TSN supports various queuing and scheduling mechanisms and allows the integration of multiple traffic types in a single network. Network Calculus (NC) can be used to calculate upper bounds for latencies and buffer sizes within these networks, for example, for safety or real-time traffic. We explain the relevance of NC for TSN-based computer communications and potential areas of application. Different NC analysis approaches have been published to examine different parts of TSN and this paper provides a survey of these publications and presents their main results, dependencies, and differences. We present a consistent presentation of the most important results and suggest an improvement to model the output of sending end-devices. To ease access to the current research status, we introduce a common notation to show how all results depend on each other and also identify common assumptions. Thus, we offer a comprehensive overview of NC for industrial networks and identify possible areas for future work.

AB  - Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a key enabler technology for Industry 4.0. TSN provides the basic building block for network convergence: instead of having multiple, parallel communication networks for each traffic type in the factory, it provides a common ground that can fulfill the Quality-of-Service requirements of all existing networks with a single, shared infrastructure. The next step on this path is the convergence of the computing infrastructure, where on-premises cloud technology will be used to aggregate the different process controllers into a cloud computing environment. In this paper, we highlight some of the challenges in the cloudification of TSN traffic endpoints, and present an architecture design for TSN and cloud integration. We have set up a testbed and carried out measurements to show how the requirements of an industrial network can be met with cloudified TSN functions.

AB  - In this work authors present a Traffic Shaping Engine (TSE) intended for the next generation of Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) compliant Network/System on Chip (NoC/SoC) devices, targeting especially the automotive industry. The TSE provides a new layer of abstraction that allows to integrate all the TSN standards related to traffic shaping that are applicable to In-Vehicle Networks (IVNs) according to IEEE P802.1DG, providing a common interface for the management of the shapers, independently of the TSN algorithms in place. The TSE provides a Hardware (HW) architecture that solves the traffic shaping processing and adaptation to network status (load balancing) fully autonomously, without intervention from the CPU. The TSE is designed as a coarse-grain configurable HW co-processor or HW Accelerator (HWA) that can be attached to the system CPU, which follows a Software Defined Networking approach. It provides the right interface and set of parameters to handle all the required traffic shaping algorithms in a common and centralized manner in the control plane, while keeping a common data plane regardless of the traffic shaping processing required. The proposed strategy allows to minimize latency and maximize throughput and Quality of Service, contributing towards future automotive Gateway solutions for IVNs with stringent real-time routing and tunneling constraints.

AB  - The Time Sensitive Networking task group of IEEE 802.1 has developed a number of enhancements to the priority queueing architecture used by Ethernet. Perhaps the most notable one is the Time-Aware Shaper, which can perfectly isolate priority classes in time with periodically scheduled traffic gates. It requires near-perfect clock synchronization across the entire network, though, and a central network controller to calculate the timings for the traffic gates. As a cheaper alternative, we developed the Asynchronous Time-Aware Shaper that needs no clock synchronization, or a central controller. It uses local processes at each switch port to track the high priority streams, predict the arrival times of their next frames, and control the traffic gates such that the low priority streams are not interfering.

AB  - This paper proposes a method to efficiently map the legacy Ethernet-based traffic into Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) traffic classes considering different traffic characteristics. Traffic mapping is one of the essential steps for industries to gradually move towards TSN, which in turn significantly mitigates the management complexity of industrial communication systems. In this paper, we first identify the legacy Ethernet traffic characteristics and properties. Based on the legacy traffic characteristics we presented a mapping methodology to map them into different TSN traffic classes. We implemented the mapping method as a tool, named Legacy Ethernet-based Traffic Mapping Tool or LETRA, together with a TSN traffic scheduling and performed a set of evaluations on different synthetic networks. The results show that the proposed mapping method obtains up to 90% improvement in the schedulability ratio of the traffic compared to an intuitive mapping method on a multi-switch network architecture.

AB  - As Ethernet rapidly replaces legacy networks as the core high-speed network in helicopter’s avionics and mission systems, we ask in this paper the question of the technical benefits of migrating to Ethernet Time-Sensitive-Networking (TSN). Indeed, TSN has become a rich toolbox of mechanisms and protocols to address Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements pertaining to timing and reliability. TSN is quickly becoming the prominent technology for wired high-speed communications in a variety of application domains like automotive, industry 4.0 and telecom. In this context, this work explores the use of TSN timing QoS mechanisms for helicopter’s avionics and mission systems on a case-study representative of the communication requirements of next-generation systems. This study aims to provide quantified insights into what can be expected from TSN in terms of timing, memory usage and extensibility.

AB  - A unified network architecture, allowing for simultaneous transmission of multiple real-time (RT) and non-RT traffic classes, is becoming increasingly important for the realization of industrial IoT. There is yet no clear approach allowing multiple state-of-the-art Industrial Ethernet applications, exhibiting different isochronous hard real-time traffic patterns, to share the same network resources alongside best-effort traffic. This paper presents an approach to integrating heterogeneous Industrial Ethernet applications over Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN). We deploy different real-time schedulers that are embedded in a Software-defined Network (SDN) controller to allow different applications with various traffic patterns and Qualityof-Service (QoS) requirements to share the same network. This integration is accomplished by providing an abstraction that combines the requirements of the Industrial Ethernet application and the TSN network capabilities and constraints.

AB  - Connected cars need robust protection against network attacks. Network anomaly detection and prevention on board will be particularly fast and reliable when situated on the lowest possible layer. Blocking traffic on a low layer, however, causes severe harm if triggered erroneously by falsely positive alarms. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a concept for detecting anomalous traffic using the ingress control of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). We build on the idea that already defined TSN traffic descriptors for in-car network configurations are rigorous, and hence any observed violation should not be a false positive. Also, we use Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technologies to collect and evaluate ingress anomaly reports, to identify the generating flows, and to ban them from the network. We evaluate our concept by simulating a real-world zonal network topology of a future car. Our findings confirm that abnormally behaving individual flows can indeed be reliably segregated with zero false positives.

AB  - In-car networks based on Ethernet are expected to be the first choice for future applications in the domain of info-and entertainment. However, the full benefit of a technologically integrated in-car network will only become rewarding with an Ethernet-based backbone, unifying several automotive domains in a single infrastructure. Today, there is remarkable interest in the IEEE 802.1 Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) protocol suite, that provides end-to-end performance guarantees in Ethernet networks. But for the strict timing requirements of automotive control-traffic, these guarantees are too weak. An extension of Ethernet AVB with synchronous time-triggered traffic can overcome these limitations. In this paper, we investigate the coexistence of synchronous and asynchronous traffic by experimentally adding time-triggered messages to the credit-based shaper of AVB in a straightforward way. Based on simulations and analytical evaluations, we quantify the impact of such integration concepts for a reasonable design range. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a shaping strategy with concurrent AVB and time-triggered message, but show a significant impact of the schedule design on the asynchronous AVB streams. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for configurations that can improve end-to-end network performance for in-car applications by over 100%.

AB  - An extensive list of time-sensitive applications requiring ultra-low latency ranging from a few microseconds to a few milliseconds are presented in recent publications and IEEE standards. Time-sensitive applications, include industrial, critical healthcare and transportation applications as also applications for Smart Grids and the Internet of Vehicles – one of the most active research fields of Intelligent Transportation Systems of Smart Cities. In this work, we mainly set our focus on the suite of safety applications which attracts strong interest from the research community, as it aims to avoid road accidents and save lives. The IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) set of standards specifies fundamental real-time characteristics. Nevertheless, as TSN works on Data Link layer (Layer 2 of the OSI model) the benefits of these characteristics fade away when other layers are crossed from the Application layer (Layer 7). Indicatively, recent research works report latencies on the order of tens of seconds when benchmarking Data Stream Processing and IoT platforms, and thus they are not suited for time-critical applications. Such platforms mainly use loosely coupled components with asynchronous communication. On Application layer, we propose a novel End-to-End Synchronous, Distributed Architecture for Large-Scale, High-Bandwidth, Ultra-Low Latency Data Stream Processing. Through our Big Data Stream analysis experiments (4.7 Gbit/s total average aggregated throughput, 1 Terabyte in-memory distributed database, 4 milliseconds average query latency) we have demonstrated the suitability of our architecture for time-sensitive applications such as accident avoidance for the Internet of Vehicles.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) describes a set of features extending the functionalities and Quality of Service (QoS) of standard Ethernet to enable determinism, reliability and reconfigurability, key requirements for Industry 4.0. The TSN profile for industrial automation (IEC/IEEE 60802 standard) defines specific options to favor reliability and reconfigurability. Nevertheless, there are multiple possible options for scheduling to guarantee determinism. Today, the scheduling standards in TSN can be categorized according to the implemented communication paradigm: asynchronous or synchronous. This paradigm is of utmost importance to quantify the synchronization need and the reconfigurability effort. The main contribution of this work is the specification of an asynchronous TSN-compliant network for Industry 4.0, FactoRing, that bridges the gap between both paradigms to guarantee low bounded jitters and latencies, without the need of synchronization and complex network planning. Moreover, FactoRing supports ring-based topologies to significantly reduce installation wiring and costs. In this paper, we first present the main industry 4.0 requirements and assess the ability of recommended TSN mechanisms for industrial automation versus such requirements. Afterwards, we detail the main features of Factoring including QoS, reliability and reconfiguration management. Finally, preliminary results on performance metrics like jitters, latencies and buffer usage are discussed and the first conclusions on the promises of Factoring to meet Industry 4.0 requirements are derived.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) provides mechanisms for strictly controlling network latency, jitter, and packet loss in LAN environments. These technologies enable various applications, including industrial automation and professional audio/video bridging. Current TSN network architectures heavily rely on a centralized control model inspired by Software-Defined Networking (SDN). While this approach works well for small-scale L2 TSN networks, it is not feasible for larger-scale L3 deterministic networks involving multiple network segments and routers. This paper proposes and evaluates distributed mech-anisms for Deterministic Networking (DetNet) that enable: i) the discovery of priority queue information using a link-state protocol or an exploration-based approach, ii) the planning of network paths using network calculus based on available queue information, and iii) a distributed signaling mechanism for configuring the data plane of the deterministic network. Simulations demonstrate the potential of these protocols in large-scale networks and validate their bounded delay and packet loss.

AB  - Delay and jitter sensitive industrial control and remote driving application-driven network by best-effort to deterministic service. To meet the deterministic application of delay and jitter demands, industry and academia have conducted detailed research on stream filtering shaping and queue forwarding control. However, the study seldom considers the effects of long-distance topology change, transmission delay fluctuations and short-time traffic overloads, challenging to meet deterministic requirements under large-scale backbone networks. For this challenge, this paper based on Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding, considers source-destination path properties and deterministic traffic intensity. We propose Global Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding 3-Queue. In the deterministic network simulation system based on OMNeT, we constructed the actual network topology NSFNET, which has 14 nodes and 21 links. Experiments compare queue forwarding control mechanisms such as CQF and GCQF-3. The experimental results show that under the traffic matrix with 120% strength, the delay is reduced by 23.6%, the jitter is reduced by 53.6%, and the packet loss rate is reduced by 61%. It shows that GCQF-3 can timely adjust the gate-control and queueing priority according to the deterministic traffic state, achieves the best in delay, jitter and network utilization.

AB  - We compute bounds on end-to-end worst-case latency and on nodal backlog size for a per-class deterministic network that implements Credit Based Shaper (CBS) and Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS), as proposed by the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standardization group. ATS is an implementation of the Interleaved Regulator, which reshapes traffic in the network before admitting it into a CBS buffer, thus avoiding burstiness cascades. Due to the interleaved regulator, traffic is reshaped at every switch, which allows for the computation of explicit delay and backlog bounds. Furthermore, we obtain a novel, tight per-flow bound for the response time of CBS, when the input is regulated, which is smaller than existing network calculus bounds. We also compute a per-flow bound on the response time of the interleaved regulator. Based on all the above results, we compute bounds on the per-class backlogs. Then, we use the newly computed delay bounds along with recent results on interleaved regulators from literature to derive tight end-to-end latency bounds and show that these are less than the sums of per-switch delay bounds.

These challenges are often overlooked when the research results are implemented in an academic environment. In particular, we discuss various challenges regarding the implementation and integration of the response-time analysis for heterogeneous networks, comprising of CAN and Ethernet AVB, as a plug-in for the Rubus Analysis Framework. Rubus tool suite is used for the model- and component-based development of software for vehicular real-time systems by several international companies. We also discuss preliminary solutions to deal with the challenges.

AB  - This paper presents the first holistic modeling approach for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) communication that integrates into a model-and component-based software development framework for distributed embedded systems. Based on these new models, we also present an end-to-end timing model for TSN-interconnected distributed embedded systems. Our approach is expressive enough to model the timing information of TSN and the timing behaviour of software that communicates over TSN, hence allowing end-to-end timing analysis. A proof of concept for the proposed approach is provided by implementing it for a component model and tool suite used in the vehicle industry. Moreover, a use case from the vehicle industry is modeled and analyzed with the proposed approach to demonstrate its usability.

AB  - Standard Ethernet networks cannot provide solutions to handle latency sensitive applications efficiently. The packet scheduling algorithms like First In First Out (FIFO), Class Based Queueing (CBQ), and others do not provide efficient solutions to Quality of Service (QoS) parameters like end-toend delay, packet loss, and jitter. Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) can be used as a solution to provide QoS to time sensitive applications. TSN has emerged as a future of realtime communication. The main advantage of TSN is that it enables determinism by supporting time critical traffic while the best effort traffic is also present in the network. This paper explores two of the most popular and widespread traffic shaping mechanisms in TSN: Time Aware Shaper (TAS) and Credit Based Shaper (CBS). IEEE 802.1Qbv is used for delivering time assurance using TAS. CBS is a key traffic shaping algorithm to provide bandwidth assurance to the time critical and real time traffic, such as the audio traffic. This paper evaluates TAS and CBS using TSN enabled Network Interface Cards (NIC) with time synchronization, real time kernel and real traffic, which includes time sensitive traffic and elastic background traffic.

AB  - Ultra-low latency (ULL) data transmission is essential for many network applications. The IEEE 802.1Qbv Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) is a typical mechanism for providing ULL data transmission in bridged networks. All TAS enabled nodes must be time-synchronized and their gate time schedule in the gate control list (GCL) must be pre-configured considering the data arrival time and the maximum burst size. Consequently, the bandwidth utilization is drastically deteriorated if the data size becomes small, because no data can be forwarded until the state of the gate changes. Although the underutilization of link bandwidth can be addressed with gate shrunk (GS-)TAS which enables runtime reconfiguration of the GCL using a GS-frame at the end of an express traffic. However, the states of gates cannot be appropriately controlled with the existing scheme if there are many express streams. To address this issue, this paper proposes a concept of multi-stream gate control for TAS. The proposed idea enables runtime reconfiguration of the GCL to avoid the reduction in bandwidth utilization irrespective of the burst size and the number of streams. The performance of the proposed scheme was confirmed with computer simulations.

AB  - Factory automation is evolving from a hierarchical structure towards an interconnected architecture in which systems at different levels can communicate seamlessly with each other. This requires an appropriate replacement of proprietary fieldbus systems in the automation sector. A promising solution to implement cross-plane end-to-end real-time capable communication between computing nodes is proposed in literature. The usage of Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) as the information model with the Publish-Subscribe (PubSub) communication mechanism in combination with Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is presented to fulfill the requirements for message transmission. In contrast to the state of the art of configuring fieldbus systems, the configuration of such a real-time communication node has to be done manually. This process is complex, as deep knowledge in different domains is required. In this work we elaborate the requirements for such a communication node and present the resulting implementation challenges, which can be used as the basis for a configuration tool.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is considered one of the most promising solutions to address hybrid traffic scheduling. The TSN working group proposed various shaping mechanisms (e.g., time-aware shaper (TAS), credit-based shaper (CBS), and cyclic queuing and forwarding (CQF)). However, scheduling hybrid traffic with different quality of service (QoS) requirements is still not effectively solved, since QoS requirements are hard to meet by standalone mechanism or combined mechanisms with fixed time slot divisions. In this paper, we propose a TAMCQF model to achieve deterministic hybrid traffic scheduling. We formally define the problem of configuring TAMCQF-based networks with different scheduling constraints and time slot division granularity. We develop a mixed linear programming formulation (MILP) and solve it with a state-of-the-art ILP solver. The simulation results show that TAMCQF can achieve zero jitter that TAMCQF can achieve zero jitter for TT traffic compared to CQF and reduce time cost by 103× level when handling over 250 hybrid flows compared to TAS.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is becoming more important in automotive and industrial sectors. There is no clear strategy how to use TSN to improve and migrate the established real-time protocols without excluding legacy devices. This paper presents a realistic concept to integrate TSN into automation networks. We choose Sercos as a deterministic Industrial-Ethernet protocol to be extended with the TSN Standards IEEE 802.1AS-Rev and IEEE 802.1Qbv. By simulating the Sercos over TSN network, we investigate the impact of integrating a TSN-capable switch in a Sercos network to enable a topology extension from line/ring to star/tree. By comparing the impact of: increasing the data rate and topology extension, we demonstrate the improvement of Industrial-Ethernet timing performance.

AB  - The need to dynamically assign capacity to various network slices in virtualized C-RAN enabled 5G and beyond packet-switched networks require the added fronthaul network to be able to deliver standard bitrates. We therefore design a novel fronthaul network scheduling architecture and scheme based off the Burst Limiting Shaper (BLS) mechanism to provide Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to service differential traffic which include ultra Reliable and Low Latency communication (URLLC) traffic and non-URLLC traffic In this work we compare our strategy to Weighted Round Robin (WRR) scheduling algorithm under bursty and low traffic conditions. Simulations are used to evaluate our schemes performance ad show how well it compares to WRR.

AB  - To overcome the limitation of strictly non-preemptive frame transmission in Ethernet networks, the IEEE 802.1Qbu standard was introduced. This standard specifies a one-level frame preemption paradigm wherein, depending on their priority levels, frames are grouped into two categories: namely, the “express frames” and the “preemptable frames”. These two categories are given with the interpretation that (1) only express frames can preempt preemptable frames; and (2) two frames belonging to the same category cannot preempt each other. While this approach partially solves the problem, some preemptable frames can still suffer long blocking periods, irrespective of their individual priority levels. Indeed, there are frames that do not fall into the express frames category, but nevertheless have firm timing requirements that can only be met if they can benefit from preempting lower priority frames. To ameliorate the condition of such frames, we propose a multi-level preemption paradigm. Specifically, we expose the limitations of the one-level preemption approach experimentally; and we present the feasibility and implementation requirements of the multi-level preemption scheme in details.

AB  - Time Sensitive Networks (TSN) emerge as the set of sub-standards incorporating real-time support as an extension of standard Ethernet. In particular, IEEE 802.1Qbv defines a time-triggered communication paradigm with the addition of a time-aware shaper governing the selection of frames at the egress queues according to a predefined schedule, encoded in so-called Gate Control Lists (GCL). Nonetheless, the design of compositional systems with real-time demands requires a proper configuration of these mechanisms to truly achieve the temporal isolation of communication streams with end-to-end timeliness guarantees. In this paper we address how the synthesis of communication schedules for GCLs defined in IEEE 802.1Qbv can be formalized as a system of constraints expressed via first-order theory of arrays (T_A). We formulate the necessary constraints showing the suitability of the theory of arrays and discuss optimization opportunities arising from the underlying scheduling problem. Our evaluation using general-purpose SMT/OMT solvers proves the validity of the approach, scaling well for small-to medium-networks, and exposing trade-offs for the time needed to synthesize a schedule. Furthermore, we conduct a comparison against previous work and conclude the appropriateness of the method as the basis for future TSN scheduling tools.

AB  - Since, over an in-vehicle network, the kind of traffic exceeds the number of priorities that IEEE 802.1TSN can support, utilization of in-class QoS control is inevitable. Thus, this paper evaluates the effect of the in-class control on QoS over Ethernet-based in-vehicle networks by experiment. This experiment assumes that each ECU can generate traffic of multiple priorities; it compares the QoS when QoS control is performed within the ECU (in-class control) or switch and when QoS control is used only at the switch. The experiments treat CBS, one of the QoS controls of IEEE 802.1TSN; it adopts the mean delay, maximum delay, and delay jitter as QoS parameters. The experimental results indicate that in-class control is only necessary when the network is heavily congested. The paper concludes that it is essential to maintain QoS for high-priority traffic when the network is highly congested by low-priority traffic.

AB  - Highly reliable, scalable and deployable net-works with strict temporal constraints are inevitable for future cyber physical systems. Due to widespread usage and success of Ethernet technologies, the Time Sensitive Networking task group introduces a series of protocol extensions to the IEEE 802.1 Ethernet standard. These standards provide real time capabilities and performance improvements. Simulation environments are intensively used to investigate correctness and applicability of new protocol suites. This paper presents an OPNET simulation framework for simulating TSN time-based features. Our framework implements ingress time-based policing and enhancements for scheduled traffic as an extensions of the Ethernet standard. We describe the implementation details of our simulation models which provide temporal properties. We also evaluate and compare our results with the expected behaviors of the aforementioned protocols.

AB  - In IEEE 802.1Q with Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) extension, the timing constraint is enforced by providing deterministic transmission policies when both Real-Time (RT) and Non-Real-Time (NRT) streams are transmitted. The transmission of non-preemptive NRT streams may, however, unexpectedly intrude into the next time slice of RT streams, thus jeopardizing RT streams' timing constraints. Guard bands are therefore introduced to prevent such negative influence by inserting a duration in front of every time slice that contains RT streams, but one major disadvantage is wasting bandwidth in resource-limited networks. Several methods have been proposed to reduce guard bands by aggregating time slices to tackle the above problem. However, there is still room for improvement in reduction. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimized TSN scheduling synthesis for RT streams in IEEE Standard 802.1Qbv with a global perspective to efficiently reduce guard bands. We add a constraint to avoid creating extra guard bands during scheduling generation and an objective function to minimize the maximum number of guard bands. Due to the general constraints and objective function, our proposed method can also apply to streams with multiple periods. In the performance evaluation, we show that the proposed approach effectively reduces guard bands while achieving an average improvement of up to 38.6% against the state-of-the-art.

AB  - Over the last years, we have seen the emergence of (hyper-)distributed applications, which tend to be provisioned over resources that span IoT devices, IoT gateways, and compute nodes from edge computing infrastructures. The deployment and orchestration of such services benefits from types of IoT middleware, known as Virtual Objects (VOs). However, in order to reap the benefits of VOs, low-latency communication is required between the IoT devices and their associated VOs. To this end, we utilize Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), which has paved the way for the timely delivery of delay-sensitive traffic. Our main contribution lies in the design and evaluation of a TSN scheduler, which is compliant with the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS). In this respect, we present a constraint programming formulation for the TSN scheduling problem at hand. A salient feature of the proposed TSN scheduler is its ability to compute the schedule periods both efficiently and at small time-scales. The latter is of crucial importance for dynamic conditions, where the association of IoT devices and their virtual counterparts is subject to change.

AB  - Switched Ethernet has been, and will also be increasingly common in current and future real-time and embedded systems. The IEEE 802.1 working group has recently developed standards and technologies, commonly referred to as Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), to enhance switched Ethernet with timeliness and dependability. We address, for the first time, the synthesis problem for the TSN frame preemption standards IEEE 802.3br-2016 and 802.1Qbu-2016 by introducing two new configuration parameters: flow to queue and queue to Express/Preemptable MAC interface assignments. We present an optimization framework to determine these configuration parameters with reliability as the optimization goal. Our proposed framework is shown to outperform commonly used priority-assignment as well as intuitive approaches.

AB  - Ethernet is nowadays a promising communication technology for automotive applications as, comparing with the existing in-vehicle networks, it offers high bandwidth and a significant reduction of cabling costs, while meeting the EMC/EMI requirements of automotive communications. The IEEE 802.1Q standard is one of the base standards of Time-Sensitive Networking. It offers several benefits, such as the real-time support, as it provides bounded latency to time-constrained traffic classes, with zero jitter and congestion-free transmissions, and the capability to handle multiple traffic classes on the same channel. The IEEE 802.1Q standard specifies multiple features, that support different ways to handle the transmission of Ethernet frames. In this paper a comparative performance assessment of three network configurations defined in the IEEE 802.1Q standard for automotive applications are presented. The assessment results are obtained using the OMNeT++ framework. The comparison between the results of these three different network configurations, using realistic traffic patterns, provides a quantitative evaluation of the network performance in terms of maximum end-to-end delays and absolute jitter.

AB  - MOCA is a suite of Internet multimedia tools to facilitate groupwork in a distance learning environment, built using standard Java utilities. MOCA's original aim was to allow several users to work simultaneously on multimedia documents using a multimedia whiteboard. Now MOCA supports both asynchronous and synchronous collaboration models. Tools for asynchronous multimedia presentation, annotation, surveys, and HW have also been developed using the same basic framework. To enable synchronous collaboration sessions between students, TAs and instructors, we have developed a scheduler tool. The system is being piloted in an advanced VLSI chip design course which allows multimedia collaboration between design teams distributed at academic sites at UMASS/Amherst, ENST/Paris, Pusan South Korea and industrial sites at IBM, Intel, AMD and Motorola.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is one of the core network technologies of the future industrial internet. It is improved on the basis of the traditional Ethernet, and provides low jitter, low delay and high reliability deterministic data transmission guarantee for time-sensitive data traffic. This paper first gives an overview of time-sensitive networking, and then focuses on four key mechanisms in TSN: time synchronization, traffic scheduling and shaping, reliability of traffic transmission, and network resource configuration and management. Finally, we analyze the development trend of key technologies in TSN and make a summary.

AB  - Cybersickness and control-loop instabilities are two main concerns in Tactile Cyber-Physical Systems (TCPS). TCPS applications demand stringent bounds on end-to-end latencies to avoid their occurrences. Traditional best-effort networks cannot guarantee packet latencies in the presence of external traffic. On the other hand, emerging deterministic networks such as IEEE 802.1 Time Sensitive Networks (TSN) can isolate time-critical flows from external traffic using IEEE 802.1Qbv Time-Aware-Shaper (TAS) to guarantee bounded end-to-end packet latencies. In this work, we devise a decenteralized dynamic scheduling protocol to Configure non-overlapping gate slots in TAS enabled TSN switches to support TCPS flows. Our protocol supports plug-and-play operation of TCPS terminals with guaranteed minimal end-to-end packet latencies. Further, we also present PYTSN, an open-source discrete-event network simulator containing models of TAS enabled TSN switches and TCPS terminals. We use PYTSN to evaluate our proposed scheduling protocol. In particular, we show the isolation of TCPS flows from external traffic and plug and play operation of TCPS terminals.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is expected to be a cornerstone in tomorrow's industrial networks. That is because of its ability to provide deterministic quality-of-service in terms of delay, jitter, and scalability. Moreover, it enables more scalable, more affordable, and easier to manage and operate networks compared to current industrial networks, which are based on Industrial Ethernet. In this article, we evaluate the maximum capacity of the asynchronous TSN networks to accommodate industrial traffic flows. To that end, we formally formulate the Flow Allocation Problem (FAP) in the mentioned networks as a convex mixed-integer non-linear program. To the best of the authors' knowledge, neither the maximum utilization of the asynchronous TSN networks nor the formulation of the FAP in those networks have been previously addressed in the literature. The results show that the network topology and the traffic matrix highly impact on the link utilization.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Deterministic Networking (DetNet) standards come to satisfy the needs of many industries for deterministic network services. That is the ability to establish a multi-hop path over an IP network for a given flow with deterministic Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees in terms of latency, jitter, packet loss, and reliability. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning-based solution, which is dubbed LEARNET, for the flow scheduling in deterministic asynchronous networks. The solution leverages predictive data analytics and reinforcement learning to maximize the network operator's revenue. We evaluate the performance of LEARNET through simulation in a fifth-generation (5G) asynchronous deterministic backhaul network where incoming flows have characteristics similar to the four critical 5GQoS Identifiers (5QIs) defined in Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) TS 23.501 V16.1.0. Also, we compared the performance of LEARNET with a baseline solution that respects the 5QIs priorities for allocating the incoming flows. The obtained results show that, for the scenario considered, LEARNET achieves a gain in the revenue of up to 45% compared to the baseline solution.

AB  - Interval Management (IM) is an FAA Next-Gen Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) In application designed to decrease the variability in spacing between aircraft, thereby increasing the efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS). One application within IM is Paired Approach (PA). In a PA operation, the lead aircraft and trail aircraft are both established on final approach to dependent parallel runways with runway centerline spacing less than 2500 feet. The trail aircraft follows speed guidance from the IM Avionics to achieve and maintain a desired spacing behind the lead aircraft. PA operations are expected to require a new separation standard that allows the aircraft to be spaced more closely than current dependent parallel separation standards. The behavior of an airborne collision avoidance system, such as TCAS II or ACAS Xa, must be considered during a new operation such as PA, because the aircraft are so closely spaced. This analysis quantified TAs and RAs using TCAS II Change 7.1 and ACAS Xa software with simulated IM PA operations. The results show no RAs using either TCAS II Change 7.1 or ACAS Xa, negligible TAs using TCAS II Change 7.1, and acceptable numbers of TAs using ACAS Xa software during simulated PA operations.

AB  - The IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group specifies a set of standards that enables real-time communication with predictable and bounded delays over the Ethernet. Specifically, TSN introduces a new set of so-called shapers, which regulate traffic arrival and transmission in the networks. Prominent among those are the IEEE 802.1 Qbv Time Aware Shaper (TAS) and IEEE 802.1Qav Credit-Based Shaper (CBS). Another traffic control mechanism is the IEEE 802.1Qbu Frame Preemption. Most works in the literature have focused on the quantitative performance comparison between these mechanisms. However, the discussion on how they compare in terms of implementation cost has received less attention. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of the implementation cost of the aforementioned TSN traffic control mechanisms. This comparison can help system designers in choosing which of the mechanism(s) to deploy for their applications.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) enables deterministic transmission on standard Ethernet with the time-aware shaping enhancements. The time-aware shaper usually requires complex schedules to control the input and output of packet queues of switches, and is applied in TSN systems with static time-sensitive traffic. However, for scenarios with dynamic deterministic transmission requirements, like industrial Internet of Things (IoT), such shaper may no longer be applicable as the heavy recomputation and reload overhead of scheduling configurations for each switch. To solve this problem, IEEE 802.1Qch recently proposed a Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) based shaper that does not require complicated configurations. But currently no scheduling algorithm can be directly applied to the CQF based shaper with dynamic time-sensitive traffic. To make CQF practical in the dynamic TSN application scenarios, new scheduling algorithms are urgently required.In this paper, we propose an on-line flow injection time scheduling algorithm, namely Fits, to fully explore the deterministic transmission ability of IEEE 802.1 Qch based TSN networks. It incrementally generates traffic schedules for new time-sensitive flows by adjusting the sending time on the network adapter based on network resource utilization. There is no need to reconFigure previously scheduled flows. To evaluate this algorithm, it is compared with two counterparts Naive and Tabu under various TSN system settings. The experimental results show that the successfully scheduled time-sensitive flows of the proposed algorithm is 82.5% more and 29.7% less on average than Naive and Tabu respectively. And the computation time of Fits is two orders less than Tabu in a few seconds level, which is acceptable at system run time.

AB  - The 5G system architecture envisions a converged backhaul and fronthaul network which necessitates the fronthaul links to move to an Ethernet packet based network with preemption capabilities to ensure bounded delays. Furthermore, the introduction of the PDCP aggregation node as part of the Telco Cloud introduces a lower priority midhaul link but still requiring bounded delays. This paper presents a realistic Ethernet packet based 5G transport network with fronthaul express traffic and lower priority, preemptable, midhaul/backhaul traffic in a multi-hop network connecting the remote radio units and the baseband unit to the Telco Cloud and the packet core. The system includes an intelligent scheduler that aggregates and schedules midhaul/backhaul traffic by exploiting the inter-packet gaps without impacting the delay or PDV of the fronthaul streams. Analytical and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheduling algorithm.

AB  - Due to ever-increasing bandwidth requirements of modern automotive applications, Ethernet AVB is becoming a standard high-speed bus in automotive E/E architectures. Since Ethernet AVB is tailored to audio and video entertainment, existing analysis approaches neglect the specific requirements and features of heterogeneous E/E architectures and their applications. This paper presents a timing analysis technique based on Real Time Calculus to consider Ethernet AVB in complex E/E architectures, reflecting key features such as static routing and stream reservation, fixed topology, and real-time applications. A comparison with a simulation on case studies from the automotive domain gives evidence that the proposed technique delivers valuable bounds for complete sensor-to-actuator chains, enabling automatic system synthesis and design space exploration approaches.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is an emerging network technique used in real-time communication. There are three typical traffic types in TSN: Time-Triggered (TT) traffic with strict time stability requirements, Audio-Video-Bridging (AVB) traffic with large bandwidth and bounded latency requirements, and Best-Effort (BE) traffic. This paper presents an analytical latency model for AVB traffic in TSN considering TT traffic. According to the time-slots of TT traffic, an accurate single-hop service curve for AVB traffic is established based on Network Calculus, from which a more precise queueing delay through one hop can be calculated. Moreover, a strict worst-case end-to-end latency of AVB traffic can be obtained by the calculated queueing delays. We evaluate the proposed model in a real network environment, and the results show that the proposed model is more accurate and more accordance with actual circumstance compared with other methods.

AB  - Edge Computing Platforms (ECP) increasingly integrate applications with mixed-criticality requirements. In this paper, we consider that critical applications and Edge applications share an ECP. Critical applications are implemented as periodic hard real-time tasks and messages and have stringent timing and security requirements. Edge applications are implemented as aperiodic tasks and messages, and are not critical. We assume that the critical tasks are scheduled using static cyclic scheduling, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is used for dependable communication, and Remote Attestation (RA) is employed to check that the platform components are secure. We formulate an optimization problem for the joint scheduling of critical and Edge applications, such that (i) the deadlines of the critical applications are guaranteed at design-time, (ii) the platform has resources to perform RA, and (iii) we can successfully accommodate multiple dynamic responsive Edge applications at runtime. We evaluate our approach on a realistic use case. The results show that our approach generates dependable schedules that can meet the timing constraints of the critical applications, have enough periodic slack to perform RA for security, and can accommodate Edge applications with a shorter response time.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) introduces standardized mechanisms that add real-time capabilities to IEEE 802.1 Ethernet networks. In particular, the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) can be used to send frames in a deterministic fashion according to a predefined global schedule. Existing methods for generating the global communication schedule enforce isolation either in the time or in the space domain. This extended abstract presents a novel, more flexible window-based scheduling algorithm which removes the previously required isolation constraints for Scheduled Traffic (ST) by integrating worst-case delay analysis to guarantee bounded latency.

AB  - Industry 4.0 involves the networking of production equipment. This can be achieved thanks to the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) set of network standards. However, this new paradigm brings new challenges because TSN features optimization relies on the dynamic characteristics of the underlying communication network (e.g., network topology, routing strategy, critical flows requirements, etc.). This paper focuses on the case of the IEEE 802.1Qbv standard by exploring the applicability of a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach in order to reduce the configuration time of the TSN-specific parameters, compared to exact or heuristic methods.

AB  - In the last decade, Ethernet networks that require real time constraints are massively increased. Switched Ethernet is reshaping in-vehicle communications. To meet real-time requirements for diverse data types in automotive communications, Quality-of-Service protocols that go beyond the mere use of priorities are required. In Vehicle networks requirements are evolving and need better Quality-of-Service (QoS) options. This applies also for industrial networks implementation. Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) IEEE 802.1 Task working group are providing wide variety of Standard. This standard widens the design space for car networks so lots of ideas exists now. We try in this paper to the best of our knowledge, give insights about the studies that were developed for mainly for car networks as well as open issues that are still needs further research.

AB  - The IEEE 802.1 TSN working group published a set of standards which adds new functionalities to switched Ethernet networks. These new functionalities notably aim at making the design of deterministic Ethernet networks possible, enabling their use for real-time applications. This determinism comes however at the cost of a greatly increased complexity in configuration effort, especially for largescale networks. In addition, this new complexity also affects the network simulation tools that are commonly used when designing such networks. As most of the existing ones only partially support new TSN functionalities, one has often to combine several simulators for achieving a reliable TSN network design. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach which aims at assisting the design of TSN networks. Modeling allows the creation of a formal representation of the network which can then be used to automatically generate configurations. This approach has been successfully implemented as a TSN configuration software called MoBACT, that enables the use of multiple simulation/emulation tools during the design phase by generating configurations for different targets for easing crosscheck of simulation results. Since each generated configuration is derived from the same representation of the network, our approach guarantees the consistency of the different configurations generated for each tool.

AB  - Real-time networks are used by distributed embedded systems of increasing complexity. This leads to a need for precise design and configuration techniques for these networks.This paper presents an approach for the iterative configuration of a real-time network and the associated distributed real-time control application that is to be deployed on it.The approach consists in combining network modeling and Component-Based Software Engineering techniques to automatically calculate the model of the data streams that will be exchanged over the network.The paper explains how to calculate the parameters used in data stream models from the specification of the application architecture and behavior. A single specification is used to generate both the data stream models and the infrastructure code of the application, thus providing guarantee of consistency between the behavior of the actual system and the network configuration. The use of this approach is demonstrated on an example which uses a TSN network.

It was initially defined by Airbus and internationally standardized by ARINC (664 Part 7). The key features are 802.3 Ethernet compatibility, static routing based on a virtual link concept, reserved bandwidth with granted bandwidth allocation gaps, transparent redundancy and — most importantly — deterministic latency and jitter bounds. Beside several proprietary real time Ethernet solutions, an emerging open standard with support of major semiconductor companies, currently introduces guaranteed timing behavior with the focus on transportation of video and audio streams. Audio Video Bridging (AVB) is a set of IEEE standards (802.1AS, 802.1Qat, 802.1Qav, 802.1BA, 1722) developed under the Audio/Video Bridging Task group as part of 802.1, which defines protocol layers above the Ethernet MAC & LLC layers. AVB addresses low latency and highly synchronized playback of audio and video with low packet loss, low jitter and low latency. By using priority queuing (PQ) and credit-based shaper algorithms (CBQ), it aims at guaranteeing a maximum latency of 2 ms over 7 hops for the highest priority class, with the transmission of several time sensitive and best effort streams in parallel. This work introduces the basic principles of the new AVB standard in details, compares it with the properties of the AFDX standard, and determines if the latency determinism of AVB is suitable for Avionic's requirements and if the new mass market controllers and switches developed for AVB could be a cost-effective alternative for Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) based low DAL (Design assurance Level) systems.

AB  - Data-driven services (optimization or condition monitoring) are often deployed using cloud architectures. The shop floor itself becomes more and more flexible and reconfigurable using modular machine design and Plug and Play services. These industrial use cases induce additional requirements to communication systems: scalable real-time communication from sensor to cloud as well as seamless and automatic network configuration on the shop floor. A promising data plane technology for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is IEEE 802.1 Ethernet TSN that allows convergent and time sensitive communication. The configuration of the IIoT is complex because the IIoT is often large, growing and changing over time and often consists of heterogeneous network domains because of the brownfield and manifold requirements from the applications. Software-defined Networking (SDN) has the potential to reduce the engineering effort and to increase the operation efficiency (monitoring, diagnosis, reconfiguration) of heterogeneous IIoT. SDN Control Planes can be implemented as physical-central, logic-central, distributed or hybrid architecture. The different architectures have specific advantages and disadvantages regarding QoS, throughput and engineering efforts. A key role takes the East-West interface that handles the communication between distributed SDN Controllers. SDN Data Plane agents can help to manage legacy Data Planes with SDN. A TSN Nano Profile with inverse and cooperative operating Time Aware Shaper is a migration solution to upgrade legacy communication controllers with TSN functions. The disadvantages are less throughput and increased latency for acyclic traffic.

AB  - Future applications of the Industrial Internet of Things will increasingly depend on the timely exchange of information and data. Time-Sensitive Networking, which is currently being standardized, therefore extends switched Ethernet networks by realtime communication capabilities offering deterministic message delays. In its time-triggered communication variant, a network path needs to be planned for each realtime data flow and corresponding transmission time slots have to be reserved on the network links along that path. In this paper, we present the first joint mathematical model for path routing and time slot scheduling that combines multicast support with an individual transmission scheduling on each link along a flow's path. We provide a formalization as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem and discuss several optimizations to significantly reduce the ILP solver's runtime without affecting the solution quality. In a thorough evaluation, we show the applicability of our approach and analyze the effects and trade-offs of different objective functions.

AB  - Many Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications have zero fault tolerance. Redundant networks are hence an important prerequisite for a dependable infrastructure to serve the various data traffic classes required for such applications. In this paper, we perform a delay analysis of a Quality Checks After Production (QCAP) application, which is running on a Time-Sensitive Network (TSN). We evaluate the worst-case delay of all data flows traversing the redundant TSN network using a Network Calculus (NC) based framework. We also evaluate how network parameters and configurations affect the QCAP application's service requirements.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) extends traditional Ethernet to support data traffic with ultra-reliability and time-critical requirements for a range of applications in industrial automation, automotive, and aerospace. The TSN standards present guidelines to integrate different types of data traffic over a single converged network. Therefore, it is becoming an enabling technology towards the Industry 4.0 vision of integrating information and operational technologies within future Industrial Internet of Things networks. In this paper, we develop a network calculus based framework to analyse TSN based industrial networks supporting a range of data traffic classes. We apply the framework to study and analyse a well-known industrial use case, Quality Checks After Production (QCAP), with four data traffic types with different requirements in terms of reliability and end-to-end latency. In our evaluation, we validate our framework with a computer simulation model and compare the tightness of the calculated delay bounds to a state-of-the-art approach. We then use our model to analyse the upper bounds on the worst-case delay of the different QCAP traffic types and assess the factors that impact end-to-end delay, e.g. flow offset and critical links. Finally, we compare various credit accumulation rates and their impact on the traffic delay bounds.

AB  - No specific implementation methods of traffic scheduling have been defined in the Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) protocols. Most research on traffic scheduling algorithms in TSN is for static network traffics. In this paper, a window based scheduling algorithm adaptive to network traffic fluctuations is proposed. An optimal period for Gate Control List (GCL) is firstly derived to guarantee the schedulability of control traffics. Then a dynamic window adjustment algorithm is proposed to maximize the bandwidth of best effort traffics. A simulated network is implemented based on OMNeT++/NeSTiNg simulation framework to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm significantly improves the delay and jitter performance under dynamic traffic configuration. The time-sensitive services can be guaranteed even when the traffic changes dynamically.

AB  - IEEE 802.1Qcr standard was presented for Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) by the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group. The eligibility time assignment (ETA) defined in ATS is one of implementations of urgency-based flow scheduling mechanism comparing with another implementation called Token Bucket Emulation (TBE). The ETA mechanism calculates and assigns an eligibility time value to each frame. It could be shown by simulation-based analysis that the ETA has some features better than TBE in the first-in-first-out (FIFO) order preserving and per-hop delay statistic. To be specific, the ETA is able to keep the FIFO order of frames either by using a single queue or by using multi-queues while the TBE can only keep FIFO order by using a single queue; and the mean squared error of the per-hop delay under the ETA shaping is smaller than the one under the TBE shaping, in the meaning that the ETA leads to a smaller delay jitter. In addition, simulation results show that for a flow with the same TSN configuration, the maximum per-hop delays using either the ETA or the TBE are approximately equal.

AB  - Various modern industrial applications necessitate deterministic communication, assuring that each packet of a data flow arrives at a specific time. Most existing Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) scheduling mechanisms enforce temporary isolation (any two flows cannot simultaneously be in the same queue in a network device) to ensure such deterministic property. This approach has no significant side effects in a wired Ethernet environment. However, recent calls have been made for incorporating TSN and wireless technology, such as 5th generation (5G) network, due to the device’s mobility and desire for flexibility of many emerging industrial applications. In wireless environments, the fickle nature of wireless communication will cause the existing approach to require more network resources to maintain the deterministic property, resulting in decreased schedulability. Thus, this paper aims to propose a more efficient scheduling mechanism for deterministic communication under integrated 5G and TSN environments. First, we parameterize the residence time of the bridges and analyze the requirements of deterministic communication. Then, based on the analysis, we extend and develop new scheduling rules to improve schedulability while maintaining determinism. Finally, Our evaluation via performing a set of experiments in realistic settings showcases the improved schedulability of our method with the preservation of the deterministic property.

AB  - Secrecy performance is investigated for relay networks with multiple antennas Nt at the transmitter. As K relays are available, we propose an incremental threshold relaying scheme with low complexity, where both transmit antenna selection (TAS) and relay selection are deployed without eavesdropper channel state information (CSI). Both the exact and approximate secrecy outage probability (SOP) of proposed scheme are derived with outdated CSI under the cases of maximal ratio combining (MRC) scheme at the legitimate receiver. In the high signalto-noise ratio (SNR) regime, due to outdated CSI, the secrecy diversity order of MRC decreases to Nt+1 for relay selection and K + 1 for antenna selection. Finally, simulation results validate our analysis, and show that the proposed scheme alleviates the effect of the transmitter and relay links on SOP.

AB  - Industry 4.0, Industrial Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Production Systems and Smart Factories are closely related emerging concepts expected to drive significant improvements in industrial production systems, with gains in efficiency, cost and customer satisfaction. These concepts are intimately associated with highly distributed and cooperative architectures that rely, naturally, on the network infrastructure. However, traditional industrial communication technologies hardly provide the required level of integration, flexibility and performance. Seeking a solution to this mismatch, we assess two technologies that appeared recently in the industrial realm, namely IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). TSN and SDN are fundamentally different, thus having distinct strengths and weaknesses. This paper reviews their fundamental operation principles, evaluating them qualitatively against the specific requirements posed by Industry 4.0.

AB  - To cope with requirements for low latency, the upcoming Ethernet standard Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) provides enhancements for scheduled traffic, enabling mixed-criticality networks where critical messages are sent according to a system-wide schedule. While these networks provide a completely predictable behavior of the scheduled traffic by construction, timing analysis of the critical non-scheduled traffic with hard deadlines remains an unsolved issue. State-of-the-art analysis approaches consider the interference that unscheduled messages impose on each other, but there is currently no approach to determine the worst-case interference that can be imposed by scheduled traffic, the so-called schedule interference (SI), without relying on restrictions of the shape of the schedule. Considering all possible interference scenarios during each calculation of the SI is impractical, as it results in an explosion of the computation time. As a remedy, this paper proposes a) an approach to integrate the analysis of the worst-case SI into state-of-the-art timing analysis approaches and b) preprocessing techniques that reduce the computation time of the SI-calculation by several orders of magnitude without introducing any pessimism.

AB  - Fifth generation mobile communication system (5G) integrated with Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) has been deemed as a holistic solution for realizing Industry 4.0, wherein high accuracy of time synchronization is required to enable end-to-end deterministic communication between wireless and wired devices. 3rd Generation Partnership Project(3GPP) TS 23.501 Release 16 has defined the time synchronization mechanism of industrial automation in a 5G-TSN network. This paper briefly reviews the time synchronization scheme of Release 16 and presents the time precision performance considering frequency offset inside 5G System(5GS). It is revealed that frequency offset inside 5GS leads to several microseconds of time error when transmission delay is several tens of milliseconds. As industrial applications require less than 1 microsecond time synchronicity in motion control, the effect of frequency offset inside 5GS needs to be mitigated. In the later part of this paper, a novel method to estimate the frequency offset inside 5GS is presented. The proposed method can be implemented in a simple and effective manner.

AB  - Industrial Internet and Industrial Internet of Things are emerging concepts that concern the use of Internet technologies on industrial environments. The main objective of such architectural visions is allowing a tight and seamless integration between all the functional units and layers that compose industrial processes, from the lowest levels (e.g. field-level devices such as sensors and actuators) to the higher layers, including management, logistics and maintenance. This kind of architecture promises, among other advantages, improving efficiency and flexibility, reduce installation and maintenance costs and reduce unplanned downtime. However, industrial processes often encompass functionalities like closed-loop control of physical processes that are highly critical and have strict timeliness requirements. These requirements are not satisfied by normal Ethernet-based systems. Standards such as IEEE AVB and TSN are addressing this problem, enhancing the real-time properties of Ethernet. However, considering the information presently available, such standards still present some limitations and inefficiencies. This paper reports the extension of HaRTES, an Ethernet-based real-time architecture originally developed for use at the lower layers of industrial scenarios, with MAC Bridge standard functionalities, to make it capable of being integrated on Industrial Internet of Things frameworks. The paper also presents preliminary results obtained with a prototype realization of the extended HaRTES switch.

AB  - Due to increasing bandwidth requirements, Ethernet technology is emerging in embedded systems application areas such as automotive, avionics, and industrial control. In the automotive domain, Ethernet enables integration of cameras, radars, and fusion to build active safety and automated driving systems. While Ethernet provides the necessary communication bandwidth, solutions are needed to satisfy stringent dependability and temporal requirements of such safety-critical systems. This paper introduces an asynchronous traffic scheduling algorithm, which gives low delay guarantees in a switched Ethernet network, while maintaining a low implementation complexity. We present a timing analysis and demonstrate the tightness of the delay bounds by extensive simulation experiments.

AB  - Real-time switched Ethernet communication is of increasing importance in many cyber-physical and embedded systems application areas such as automotive electronics, avionics, and industrial control. The IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group develops standards for real-time Ethernet, for example a time-triggered traffic class (IEEE 802.1Qbv-2015). New application areas, such as active safety and autonomous driving using radar, lidar, and camera sensors, which do not fall into the strictly periodic, time-triggered communication model, require a flexible traffic class that can accommodate various communication models while still providing hard real-time guarantees. In our previous work, we developed such a traffic class, Urgency-Based Scheduler (UBS), and its worst-case latency analysis. UBS is currently under standardization (P802.1Qcr) in the TSN task group. In this paper, we introduce and solve the UBS synthesis problem of assigning hard real-time data flows to queues and priorities to queues, the main parameters that determine communication latencies. The synthesis problem is particularly challenging due to the flexibility offered by UBS to aggregate flows and assign individual priority levels per network hop. We present an SMT approach, a cluster-based heuristic, and an extensive experimental evaluation.

AB  - Ethernet-based in-car communication is currently a hot topic in the automotive industry. Soon Ethernet will start to oust MOST bus in its domain of info- and entertainment applications. However, the full benefit of a technologically integrated in-car network will only become rewarding with the deployment of an Ethernet-based backbone that integrates all automotive domains on a single layer at increased bandwidth, reduced complexity and cost, while opening car intelligence for future innovations. Such backbone must transport critical control data in real-time. Standard Ethernet requires extensions to comply with the strict timing requirements of driver assistance and safety applications while simultaneously supporting broadband multimedia traffic. In this paper, we compare IEEE 802.1 AVB and Time-triggered Ethernet, two competing real-time approaches. While the first fosters over- provisioning and prioritisation, the second is based on a coordinated time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) policy for media access. By simulating a realistic in-car backbone design and traffic model, we reveal the strengths and weaknesses of both protocols and point to the diverging characteristics of event- and time-triggered policies. Our results show that in this in-car network scenario both protocols are able to meet the rigid timing requirements, while each has its unique benefits and disadvantages.

However, while industry and academia developed Ethernet variants to also meet real-time and fault-tolerant requirements, recent standardization efforts within the IEEE 802 will broadly bring standard IT switched Ethernet in future industrial communication networks. As first standards of IEEE 802.1 time-sensitive networking (TSN) are becoming published at the time of this writing, we review these standards and formulate further research challenges that still go beyond current standard developments. Furthermore, we report on recent research results from the RetNet project that target these research challenges.

The 5G standard will push into this new area of industrial communication with Release 16. In this paper, we explore ongoing standardization activities related to the integration of 5G and time-sensitive networking as a fundamental building block for flexible production. We provide a condensed summary of recent developments in 3GPP standardization and identify open issues that still need to be addressed in the future. We discuss the aspect of time synchronization in detail and make a recommendation for a way forward from the perspective of vertical applications.

AB  - The future autonomous vehicle is not only processing the copious amount of indispensable data generated by its onboard sensors but also utilizing the data from other vehicles, roadside unit (RSU) etc. Managing the mixed-criticality data requires intelligent time-sensitive scheduling and routing within the in-vehicle network (IVN) infrastructure. Use-cases related to self-adaptivity (including vehicular communication), partial networking and embedded virtualization require to change the configuration of the IVN at runtime. State-of-the-art IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards possess a grave challenge in handling runtime reconfigurations. Above mentioned use-cases foster the development of scalable and efficient dynamic scheduling and routing algorithms for TSN based IVN. In this paper, four meticulously designed heuristics are analyzed for dynamic scheduling and routing on-the-fly in TSN based IVN. One of the algorithms, Bottleneck heuristic outperforms others in term of schedulability and response time. It schedules around 16 − 22% more flows as compared to other developed heuristics depending on the network load.

AB  - Total Flow Analysis (TFA) is a method for the worstcase analysis of time-sensitive networks. It uses service curve characterizations of the network nodes and arrival curves of flows at their sources; for tractability, the latter are often taken to be linear functions. For periodic flows, which are common in timesensitive networks, linear arrival curves are known to provide less good bounds than ultimately pseudo-periodic (UPP) arrival curves, which exactly capture the periodic behaviours. However, in existing tools, applying TFA with many flows and UPP curves quickly becomes intractable because when aggregating several UPP curves, the pseudo-period of the aggregate might become extremely large. We propose a solution to this problem, called Finite-Horizon TFA. The method computes finite horizons over which arrival and service curves can be restricted without affecting the end-results of TFA. It can be applied to networks with cyclic dependencies. We numerically show that, while remaining computationally feasible, the method significantly improves the bounds obtained by TFA when using linear curves.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has emerged as a promising communication technology for automotive applications. The TSN standards provide a flexible toolkit, enabling network designers to select the features and mechanisms that best suit the application context requirements. TSN facilitates the management of diverse traffic flows through a single channel by defining transmission schemes and protocols. However, some automotive applications, such as the automated driving ones, require the support for event-driven real-time traffic, but the TSN support for this kind of flows is limited. To overcome this limitation, a recent research proposed an online Earliest Deadline First-based scheduling approach, called Deadline-TSN, able to handle various traffic classes (including the event-driven ones) in a uniform way. Deadline-TSN supports real-time traffic, but is not designed to support deterministic communications. For this reason, this paper investigates the adoption of TSN to build network setups for managing diverse kinds of in-car traffic flows, i.e., periodic and event-driven, with diverse timing constraints and presents a comparative performance evaluation between a configuration exploiting a combination of multiple TSN transmission schemes and Deadline-TSN in a realistic automotive scenario.

AB  - Switched Ethernet has been proposed as network technology for automotive and industrial applications. IEEE AVB is a collection of standards that specifies (among other elements) a set of network traffic shaping mechanisms (i.e., rules to regulate the traffic flow) to have guaranteed Quality of Service for Audio/Video traffic. However, in-vehicle control applications like advanced driver-assistance systems require much lower latencies than provided by this standard. Within the context of IEEE TSN (Time Sensitive Networking), three new traffic shaping mechanisms are considered, named Burst Limiting, Time Aware and Peristaltic shaper respectively. In this paper we explain and compare these shapers, we examine their worst case end-to-end latencies analytically and we investigate their behavior through a simulation of a particular setup. We show that the shapers hardly satisfy the requirements for 100Mbps Ethernet, but can come close under further restrictions. We also show the impact the shapers have on AVB traffic.

AB  - Ethernet is an emerging technology in the automotive domain and is capable to overcome the bandwidth and scalability limits of traditional buses like CAN or FlexRay. Formal performance analysis methods are required to verify the timing, e.g. by providing upper bounds on end-to-end latencies, in safety-critical real-time systems, such as automotive control and advanced driver assistance systems. In many real-time capable Ethernet implementations such as IEEE 802.1Q or AVB, frames can be prioritized and frames of equal priority are scheduled in FIFO order at the switch ouput ports. In this paper, we show how to exploit Ethernet's FIFO scheduling in a compositional formal performance analysis to derive tighter timing guarantees. In an automotive Ethernet setup, our proposed analysis leads to a significant reduction in end-to-end latency guarantees.

AB  - Future in-vehicle networks will use Ethernet as their communication backbone. As many automotive applications are latency-sensitive and have strict real-time requirements, a key challenge in automotive network design is the deterministic low-latency transport of latency-critical Ethernet frames. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an upcoming set of Ethernet standards, which address these requirements by specifying new quality of service mechanisms in the form of different traffic shapers. One of these traffic shapers is the burst-limiting shaper (BLS). In this paper, we evaluate whether BLS is able to fulfill these strict timing requirements. We present a formal timing analysis for BLS in order to compute worst-case latency bounds. We use a realistic automotive Ethernet setup to compare BLS against Ethernet AVB and Ethernet following IEEE 802.1Q.

AB  - Software defined networking (SDN) aims to standardize the control and configuration of network infrastructure. It consolidates network control by moving the network's control plane to a (logically) centralized controller and downgrading switches to simple forwarding devices. This offers huge advantages for future automotive Ethernet networks, including admission control (e.g. to prevent/limit congestion) or network reconfiguration (e.g. in case of faults), both based on a centralized view of the current network state. SDN's centralized architecture, however, requires additional communication, which entails a certain overhead. If SDN is used in safety-critical real-time networks, this communication is subject to strict timing requirements. In this paper, we present a formal analysis based evaluation of the general suitability of SDN for time-sensitive networks including overhead, scalability, and timing guarantees by using a realistic automotive setup.

AB  - One of the key challenges in future Ethernet-based automotive and industrial networks is the low-latency transport of time-critical data. To date, Ethernet frames are sent non-preemptively. This introduces a major source of delay, as, in the worst-case, a latency-critical frame might be blocked by a frame of lower priority, which started transmission just before the latency-critical frame. The upcoming IEEE 802.3br standard will introduce Ethernet frame preemption to address this problem. While high-priority traffic benefits from preemption, lower-priority (yet still latency-sensitive) traffic experiences a certain overhead, impacting its timing behavior. In this paper, we present a formal timing analysis for Ethernet to derive worst-case latency bounds under preemption. We use a realistic automotive Ethernet setup to analyze the worst-case performance of standard Ethernet and Ethernet TSN under preemption and also compare our results to non-preemptive implementations of these standards.

AB  - For time-sensitive networks, as in the context of IEEE TSN and IETF Detnet, cyclic dependencies are associated with certain fundamental properties such as improving availability and decreasing reconfiguration effort. Nevertheless, the existence of cyclic dependencies can cause very large latency bounds or even global instability, thus making the proof of the timing predictability of such networks a much more challenging issue. Cyclic dependencies can be removed by reshaping flows inside the network, by means of regulators. We consider FIFO-per-class networks with two types of regulators: perflow regulators and interleaved regulators (the latter reshape entire flow aggregates). Such regulators come with a hardware cost that is less for an interleaved regulator than for a perflow regulator; both can affect the latency bounds in different ways. We analyze the benefits of both types of regulators in partial and full deployments in terms of latency. First, we propose Low-Cost Acyclic Network (LCAN), a new algorithm for finding the optimum number of regulators for breaking all cyclic dependencies. Then, we provide another algorithm, Fixed- Point Total Flow Analysis (FP-TFA), for computing end-to-end delay bounds for general topologies, i.e., with and without cyclic dependencies. An extensive analysis of these proposed algorithms was conducted on generic grid topologies. For these test networks, we find that FP-TFA computes small latency bounds; but, at a medium to high utilization, the benefit of regulators becomes apparent. At high utilization or for high line transmission-rates, a small number of per-flow regulators has an effect on the latency bound larger than a small number of interleaved regulators. Moreover, interleaved regulators need to be placed everywhere in the network to provide noticeable improvements. We validate the applicability of our approaches on a realistic industrial timesensitive network.

AB  - The Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) enforces bandwidth control of high-priority traffic, thereby improving fairness by reducing delays for medium and low priorities. However, CBS can introduce latency for high priorities, especially when multiple crossed CBS are involved. To address this challenge in time-sensitive networks, we introduce a partial CBS deployment approach, wherein CBS is implemented only in selected nodes in the network. This approach aims to minimize as much as possible latency degradation for high priorities, while guaranteeing deadlines for medium and low priority flows. Additionally, this approach offers cost, complexity and legacy interoperability advantages over the full deployment of CBS. Through a motivational example, we highlight the need for an adequate approach to select the placement and configuration of CBS. Finally, we discuss the problem formulation as an optimization problem, and provide insights for appropriate solution methods.

AB  - The benefits of the currently evolving IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standard have already been globally recognized. Whereas the application of TSN in a LAN is currently widely and globally tested, TSN in a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) has not been a major focus until now. The possible benefits of utilizing co-located Edge Clouds in order to support multiple urban production sites with industrial realtime applications open a wide range of new business models. Therefore, we have analyzed the feasibility of transparently using PROFINET over TSN via a Dense Wavelength Division Multiplex (DWDM) link, where a machine park is controlled remotely by an Edge-based virtual Programmable Logic Controller (vPLC). As a result, we are able to setup a TSN connection over a MAN with a one-way delay of about 156.5 J.μs and a jitter of about 12 ns. This work can be extended to allow for dynamically provisioned TSN flows and multi-path Frame Replication and Elimination (FRER) for distributed hard real-time machine control and adoption to Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) 5G campus networks.

AB  - In the automotive industry, Ethernet is currently being introduced as a viable solution for real-time communication with high bandwidth requirements. In this paper, we present and prove a tight bound for the relative best-case response time of a frame in an Ethernet AVB switch compared to its response time in a schedule without interference. Our analysis is based on the observation that frames in a burst, scheduled using a credit shaping policy, may be scheduled earlier in case of interference than in a schedule without interference.

AB  - Time Sensitive Network (TSN) is a set of protocols working at the data link layer, which provides a delay guarantee for different services through various traffic shaping protocols. In TSN, to avoid timeouts caused by urgent services being blocked by large-bandwidth services, the IEEE 802.1 Qbu frame preemption protocol was proposed, which allows high-priority frames to reduce the delay by preempting low-priority frames. However, this mechanism will increase the delay of low-priority frames. With a unique storage structure, image and video can tolerate a certain degree of byte loss, such as color bytes, which will reduce the quality of the image but will not affect video fluency. Combined with this feature, in this paper, we propose a frame preemption enhancement mechanism assisted by frame truncation, which properly discards non-important bytes of the Ethernet frame payload field to ensure the deadline constraints. To minimize the information loss of service caused by frame truncation, we propose a frame structure based on the current Ethernet frame, which adjusts the bytes arrangement order according to their importance. In this case, when frame truncation is applied for satisfying the delay requirement, it can ensure that the discarded bytes are of the lowest importance. Simulation results show that, compared with the standard frame preemption mechanism, our proposed mechanism can send more payload bytes to the receiver without increasing the delay and jitter of other services, and the switch memory usage peak is also reduced by 12.41%.

AB  - At present, Time-Sensitive Networking has attracted extensive attention in automatic driving, Industrial 4.0, 5G and so on. TSN is used to guarantee the real-time transmission of critical traffic with bounded delay, which is realized by a variety of traffic scheduling mechanisms. One important mechanism of research is Time Aware Shaper mechanism, but current researches on this mechanism usually have the following problems: (a) It takes a long time to get the solution of the algorithm; (b) It’s difficult to schedule burst traffic and the algorithm depends on time synchronization; (c) There is a waste of bandwidth. The core idea of TAS mechanism is time division multiplexing, and the solution of transmission time is the key of traffic scheduling. This paper proposes an adaptive scheduling algorithm based on TAS to avoid above problems. First, the worst-case scheduling problem of actual traffic is seen as the scheduling problem of continuous traffic, and the transmission time of continuous traffic of the worst-case delay is analyzed; Second, the concept of queue scheduling is proposed to optimize scheduling, which achieves the adaptive scheduling of actual traffic, does not depend on time synchronization, and improve bandwidth utilization; Finally, the worst-case delay of the algorithm in actual traffic scheduling is analyzed.

AB  - Emerging latency-sensitive applications (e.g., industrial control, in-vehicle networks) require that the networks guaranteed data delivery with low, bounded latency. To meet this requirement, the IEEE 802.1 Working Group developed the time-sensitive networks (TSN) standard to enable deterministic communication on standard Ethernet. TSN technology is developed to enable deterministic communication using traffic scheduling and shaping technology. However, while the TSN standards define the mechanisms to handle scheduled traffic, it does not specify algorithms to compute fine-grained traffic scheduling policy. Current TSN flow scheduling schemes largely rely on a manual process, requiring knowledge of the traffic pattern and network topology features. Inspired by recent successes in applying reinforcement learning in online control, we propose a deep reinforcement learning aided no-waiting flow scheduling algorithm in TSN. Extensive simulations are performed to verify that our algorithm can find the optimal solution in an acceptable time.

AB  - Time sensitive networking (TSN) has been widely adopted and applied in many fields. The scheduling problem of TSN requires that the gate control list (GCL) is calculated according to the flow information in a given topology network. Conventional flow scheduling schemes are usually based on the given routing scheme, which limits the scheduling performance. Besides, current works mostly focus on the time trigger flows (TT). However, AVB flows exist as aperiodic flows in the industrial Internet. The integrated scheduling of these two types of flows is required to improve the overall schedulability. In this paper, a problem model of joint routing and GCL scheduling is proposed. An algorithm based on Tabu search (Tabu-RG) is proposed to solve the problem with specific design of neighborhood movement policy, neighborhood selection policy, as well as diversified function. Experimental results show that compared with the solver method, the proposed algorithm can save 75% of the time cost on the premise of ensuring the solution performance.

AB  - Time-sensitive network (TSN) is regarded as the perspective communication network for the intelligent vehicle application because of its reserved bandwidths, QoS mechanisms, low transmission latency. The message scheduling in the TSN have an important influence on the reliability and safety of vehicles. In this paper, the TSN messages between the vehicular electronic control units are classified into the control data traffic (CDT), the stream reservation (SR) and the best effort (BE). A hierarchical scheduling infrastructure for the three types of messages are presented, which consists of three scheduling strategies, i.e., FIFO, CBS and TAS. For the hierarchical scheduling mechanism, the influences of both FIFO and TAS on CBS are analyzed and an approach for the derivation of worst-case response times of SR message is proposed. The experiments in Vector CANoe show that the proposed method in this paper can effectively obtain the upper bound of SR message transmission in TSN. It can be used to improve the design of TSN system.

AB  - Time is central to predicting, measuring and controlling properties of the physical world, and is one of the most important constraints distinguishing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) from distributed computing in general. However, mixing the cyber and the physical presents a fundamental challenge, since computers and communications systems have abstracted away the physical layer and timing is fundamentally a physical signal. While such abstractions have yielded significant benefits, time has been a casualty. CPS used in industry today achieve time-awareness by making use of time-aware field-buses and devices with specialized proprietary software. However, this approach has proved restrictive in both the topologies achievable and the scalability of networks beyond a certain size. The new era of the Internet-of-Things and the Industrial Internet is paving the way for convergence, where time needs to be an integral part of the cyber, making integration of cyber and physical seamless. However, this requires successful research in a number of different areas. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has formed a CPS Public Working Group (PWG), with members from global industry, academia and government. This CPS PWG is tasked with creating a set of frameworks and reference architectures for CPS, to promote proper function and interoperability. Public documents from this effort will soon be available. We discuss the timing section of the CPS PWG document and focus on the status of challenges and efforts to integrate time-sensitive with best-effort processes in CPS nodes and the networks that connect them.

AB  - With the rapid increase of applications of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), supporting the rapid update and deployment of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) in dynamic scenarios has become a major challenge. However, most proposals focus on implementing offline generation of scheduling tables in TSN based on time-aware shapers (TAS), and are not suitable for automation scenarios such as network redeployment under frequent changes in devices, especially in complex networks. In order to maximize the resource efficiency of timeslots and ensure load balance, while reducing bandwidth waste to accommodate more schedulable flows, we designed a heuristic online incremental update algorithm (OIU) compatible with the TAS mechanism to deploy multicast flows. The evaluation results indicate that compared with existing work, the OIU algorithm has improved its operational efficiency by at least 20 times in high load flow scenarios. At the same time, its support of multicast has also improved load balancing on the link.

AB  - The Industrial Internet of Things, Industry 4.0 and cloud computing are fundamentally transforming today's industrial networks towards high connectivity. At the same time, the number of cyber-attacks against industrial infrastructure increased drastically over the last years, requiring to tightly limit the connectivity between the networked devices of a plant. For both of these trends, there are mechanisms evolving and partially already in place. Network segmentation with packet filters is a key mechanism for achieving improved network security while Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a promising option to realize advanced real-time applications in future industrial networks. However, although being built based on widely accepted standards and despite their practical relevance, these two concepts don't play together well. In this paper, we analyze the problems that arise when TSN networks are segmented using today's firewalls and packet filters. In particular, we discuss and quantify the impact of delay and jitter caused by packet filters on TSN traffic. We also show that the delays and jitter introduced by CPU-based filtering can be prohibitively high in real-time scenarios. Based on our analysis, we present and compare three approaches to overcome the challenges created by the combination of these two major trends in industrial networks.

AB  - There is a demand of high bandwidth in the emerging real-time applications, such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and industrial automation, where time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a promising solution. According to IEEE 802.1, a port in a TSN switch has eight prioritized FIFO (first-in first-out) queues, whose gates are opened or closed following a gate control list (GCL). Most of the existing works use one TT (time-triggered) queue for the hard real-time traffic, i.e., traffic flows with hard deadlines, which easily achieves timing determinism through GCL. Unfortunately, as a rigid mechanism, GCL is not able to handle timing jitter. In this work, we propose a hybrid strategy towards robust TSN. GCL is applied to only one queue named TT T1 for a small number of hard real-time flows with negligible jitter. The remaining flows with hard deadlines are allocated to a prioritized queue named TT T2 without GCL. Similarly, GCL is removed from all other queues handling AVB (audio-video-bridging) flows with soft deadlines and BE (best-effort) flows with no deadlines. Two analyses are proposed to obtain delay bounds for the TT T2 flows and periodic AVB flows, respectively, with interference from TT T1. Although safety is not compromised if the periodic AVB flows miss their deadlines, it is often desirable in practice to satisfy them for quality of service. In order to strike a balance, contention between the AVB queues is resolved with credit values on top of priorities. Experiments support that the delay bounds for the TT T2 and AVB flows are safe. In addition, changing the credit function can lead to different delay bounds of AVB flows, which is valuable for real-world configurations of TSN.

AB  - Satellite formation flying with functional payloads can provide flexibility and real-time services for time sensitive missions through the cooperation of intra-satellite wired and inter-satellite wireless communication systems. However, the difference between wired and wireless scheduling mechanisms will increase the instability of forwarding delay at satellite. To solve this problem, we propose a wired and wireless converged scheduling scheme. Firstly, we construct the transmission rate and time division multiple access scheduling model to describe the inter-satellite link, and the IEEE 802.1Qbv scheduling model for wired link respectively. Secondly, we analyze the influence of the position of packet in different time slots on the forwarding delay, to model the relationship between the converged scheduling and forwarding delay. Finally, we formulate the converged scheduling as a zero-one programming problem with minimum jitter, and adopt the genetic-tabu search algorithm to solve it. Simulation results demonstrate that the delay is reduced by 20%, the jitter is not higher than $40\mu\mathrm{s}$.

AB  - In order to achieve the pursuit of deterministic delay and unified network transmission in the industrial automation field, the time-sensitive networking group has developed a stream reservation mechanism to reserve the required bandwidth for time-sensitive traffic. In the distributed network configuration model, how to configure per-hop delay guarantee properly has become a key problem to restrict network performance, the reason is that an excessive loose or tight guarantee will reduce the streams that can be added to the network. Therefore, this paper proposes a stream reservation method based on reinforcement learning which can dynamically adjust the per-hop delay guarantee to improve the acceptance of streams. For this, it firstly defines the optimization problem of network configuration in the reservation process and give the per-hop delay model. Then the operation of the algorithm on bridge's data plane and control plane is simulated. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm with acceptance rate and bandwidth utilization in different scenarios, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is the future technology of industrial deterministic real-time communication. IEEE 802.1Qbv is one of the critical standards, which defines a gating mechanism, i.e. the time-aware shaper. This mechanism employs the time transmission gate and gate control list (GCL) to guarantee the real-time transmission for time-critical streams. However, most existing works focus on the single-level 802.1Qbv scheduling problems without consideration of route planning or queue assignment. In this paper, the deterministic transmission problem of multiple time-critical streams over the TSN-capable multi-hop and multi-queue network is investigated. To guarantee deterministic end-to-end delay for multiple time-critical streams, a co-design constraint set of scheduling and routing is constructed. Integrated with the constraints, a mapping method via Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) and an optimal co-design approach via Optimization Modulo Theories (OMT) are proposed. The objective of the proposed approach is to maximize network utilization by minimizing the usage of switch nodes for time-critical streams while guaranteeing the schedulability of network systems. Compared with the previous scheduling methods, the simulations show that the network utilization and the schedulability of network systems are significantly improved by the proposed approach.

AB  - Automotive Ethernet (AE) is becoming more and more relevant to the automotive industry due to its support of emerging in-car applications, which have high bandwidth demands and stringent requirements in terms of latency and time synchronization. One of the standards under consideration for AE is IEEE 802.1 Audio Video Bridging (AVB)/Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) that provides deterministic data link layer and bounded latency to real-time traffic classes. So far, this protocol stack has only been evaluated using either simulations or proprietary and expensive platforms. In this paper, we design a real testbed system for AE using general-purpose single-board computers and conduct experiments to assess the real-time performance of an open-source AVB/TSN implementation. Our preliminary results show that even under heavy load, AVB/TSN can fulfil the latency requirements of AE while keeping a constant latency variation.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking is a promising technology that supports deterministic services with bounded delay, low packet delay variation, and low packet loss. Time-Sensitive Networking consists of several components, in which traffic scheduling plays an important role to provide the delay guarantee. The traffic scheduling on the level of flow is challenging for dense traffic demands. In this paper, we propose a time-aware traffic scheduling scheme based on network virtualization to schedule a large number of flows. In the scheme, the physical queues of a network node are abstracted as virtual queues, which isolate each flow with a time offset parameter. A scheduling algorithm is designed into two stages of virtual queues mapping and schedule computation. The simulation results in a use case of industrial automation show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB  - Deterministic real-time capability is of great importance in network communication. Since Ethernet has been phased out, IEEE proposed Time-Sensitive Networking to meet the bandwidth and dependability requirement of deterministic transmission. 802.1 Qbv introduces Gate Control List (GCL) to specify the transmission timetable, but how to achieve the GCL becomes a difficult problem in TSN. Many ideas have been proposed, but the time complexity still has room to improve. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, a heuristic method based on the as-soon-as-possible (ASAP) strategy is proposed. A feasible GCL can be achieved with low time complexity and the scheduling result is also satisfactory. The rule-based heuristic method first uses time margin to sort all flows into a certain scheduling order. Then a single flow scheduling algorithm is proposed to obtain GCL based on ASAP strategy. Finally, some test cases are given to compare the difference between existing methods and the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method has a better time complexity, especially in large-scale networks.

AB  - ARINC 664, which is a heavily used protocol for modern avionics networks, is preferred due to its simplicity although its mixed-criticality support is limited. Time Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet), and IEEE Time Sensitive Networking (TSN), which utilize time synchronized schedule, are more suitable for supporting mixed-criticality applications; however, both require a fault tolerant time synchronization that makes the certification process more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic priority assignment (DPA) concept together with the burst limiting shaper (BLS) from the IEEE TSN standard to enhance the schedulability and the mixed-criticality support of ARINC 664. The decision of flow re-assignment to a new priority class is done by calculating the high priority (HP) and low priority (LP) class worst-case delays using the network calculus framework. The numerical results show that the class utilization rates can be significantly increased by using the DPA concept with and without the BLS while the deadline constraints for all classes are satisfied. Thus, the DPA can improve the schedulability and mixed-criticality of ARINC 664 without using any time synchronization mechanism.

AB  - The emergence of 5G and Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) have greatly promoted the development of Industry 4.0 with super-high bandwidth and service quality. However, they also produce massive delay sensitive traffic, such that the demand on ultra-low and deterministic end-to-end delay may not be satisfied. In this paper, an improved genetic algorithm is used to address the delay sensitive traffic scheduling problem, so as to satisfy the end-to-end delay demands of diverse new applications. Specifically, the proposed solution is designed from both the local and global perspectives. On one hand, the greedy strategy is used to calculate the earliest starting time for each delay sensitive traffic, so as to minimize the end-to-end delay in a local view. However, such greedy strategy may lead to the long waiting time for some traffic that are to be scheduled in a later time, so that the traffic may be dropped with a high probability. To avoid such situation, the genetic algorithm is applied to arrange a better scheduling order for delay sensitive traffic in a global view. Experiments indicate that the proposed solution achieves better performance in terms of the end-to-end delay.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), as a set of the protocols of data link layer, is proposed by the IEEE 802.1 task group to ensure the real-time and deterministic network communication. However, the computation and configuration of the synchronous TSN scheduling problem is a non-deterministic polynomial hard (NP-hard) problem. To deal with such a problem, a fast solution algorithm is proposed in this paper based on the flow-by-flow method and dynamic programming method. Firstly, the difficulty aroused from the synchronization error is analyzed and the corresponding queue and gating resources for frames are reserved to guarantee the feasibility of the solution. Secondly, the upper and lower bounds of each frame are defined such that dynamic time margin is calculated. In addition, with the above bounds, two necessary feasibility conditions for the synchronous TSN scheduling problem are given, which can judge whether the problem is feasible before the scheduling. Finally, the queue arrangement problem with complex coupling constraints is solved by dynamic programming method with the aim of minimizing end-to-end delay. The proposed algorithm is verified, and the results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in obtaining the feasible and satisfactory scheduling scheme within a short time.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has been deployed in time-critical industrial and automotive applications, and numerous studies have evaluated TSN scheduling mechanisms for industrial and automotive network topologies, but there is a clear lack of comparable studies for the avionics network topologies. This paper fills this gap by evaluating three widely used TSN scheduling algorithms on an Airbus A380 network topology using the OMNeT++ simulation framework. Each algorithm is evaluated in four simulation cases with varying amounts of side traffic in the network. Asynchronous traffic shaper (ATS) exhibited the unimodal distribution of end-to-end delays with a strong positive skew and peak values for both Best-effort (BE) and Time-critical (TC) traffic.

This paper firstly introduces TSN and related application scenarios, then analyzes its corresponding traffic characteristics and performances, and finally discussed the two key technologies of TSN, which provide reliable transmission and increase the air interface transmission rate respectively, which refer to Packet Data Convergence protocol (PDCP) duplication and Ethernet Header Compression (EHC).

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Ethernet is becoming a primary industrial networking technology, since it provides bounded latency capability with broad reaching ecosystem, supporting both real-time communications and non-time-critical communications in a factory. In TSN, QoS-based shaping is a core technology to provide bounded latency. Network calculus is a theory which aims at worst-case performance analysis in the network. In the paper, latency upper bound of TSN for industrial automation scenario is analyzed based on Network Calculus. Credit-based Shaping (CBS) combined with Strict Priority (SP) is used as the specific QoS-based shaping mechanism of TSN. Relating factors that influence the latency upper bound of TSN are also studied.

AB  - With the development of new power systems, the problem of large delay and large jitter in the transmission of time-sensitive data streams in power systems has put forward higher network performance requirements. This paper proposes a time-sensitive network scheduling method for substation traffic transmission problem for substation service flow. The method starts from two aspects, path and scheduling, path this paper uses genetics algorithm to optimize on the basis of K shortest path, and scheduling this paper combines the content of bandwidth reservation technology in the TSN standard protocol to schedule the substation traffic and solves it by SMT modelling using Z3 solver. The experimental results compare the scheduling method proposed in this paper with the heuristic list scheduling algorithm (HLS) and greedy adaptive search algorithm (GRASP), in which the end-to-end delay of the traffic is reduced by about 15% and the packet loss rate is reduced by about 17%.

AB  - Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) has been extensively utilized to enable the transport of time-sensitive fronthaul flows in Ethernet-bridged networks. However, recently emerged ultra-low delay and jitter requirements of the TSN pose great challenges to Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) over Ethernet. Considering this, we propose a Deterministic Transmittable Time-Based Asynchronous Scheduler (DTT-BAS) in this paper. The DTT- BAS uses the deterministic transmittable timestamp as the core scheduling mechanism, which numerically compares the timestamps to optimize the flow scheduling in the network. For the fronthaul scenario, simulation results validate that the DTT-BAS achieves a high probability of zero jitter and reduces the influence of clock skews with a delay performance close to IEEE 802.1CM frame preemption algorithm.

AB  - 5G+ deterministic network plays important role in the power system. Time sensitive network(TSN) related technologies meet the real time transmission of time-triggered power flows. In this paper, we firstly propose a network calculus based model for analyzing network maximum delays, which utilizing service curves and arrival curves to determine the upper threshold of TSN end-to-end delays by the time-aware shaper (TAS) mechanism. This model simplifies the evaluation of delay performance when compared to conventional random queuing methods. Secondly, since the service curve relies on the gate control list (GCL) configuration, this requires accurately calculating gate durations for different service flows and the precise open/close time for each queue. To tackle this challenge, this paper presents a GCL adaptive adjustment algorithm, which can identify the minimum of maximum delays by configuring gating parameters optimally. Thirdly, we use Matlab to analyze high-priority flow maximum delays across different GCL configurations, examining the effects of service flows, overlap times, gate open durations, and time intervals. Furthermore, we employ the OMNeT++ platform to conduct network simulations under predefined GCL gating settings. The results show that high-priority flows maintain an end-to-end delay below the optimized maximum delay value, consistently confirming the effectiveness of the proposed TSN delay analysis model and GCL adaptive adjustment algorithm.

AB  - Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet) is a time-critical network for industrial and avionics applications improved from the Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX). It is standardized by SAE AS6802 and satisfies strict timing transmission by use of a mixture infrastructure to support Time-Triggered (TT), Rate-Constraint (RC) and Best-Effort (BE) traffics. The key feature is a time-triggered communication paradigm according to off-line schedule table based on global synchronization. Three integration methods (preemption, timely block and shuffling) are used to resolve conflict when a TT message gets ready and a RC message is already in transmission. Besides several real-time Ethernet solutions, Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) shows great interests and attractions to satisfy the increasing and variable transmission requirements for automotive and aeronautical industry. TSN is comprised of several IEEE standards developed under IEEE 802.1 TSN Task Group, such as 802.1AS, 802.1Qav, 802.1Qat, 802.1BA, 802.1Qbv and 802.1Qbu. On top of SPQ (Static Priority Queuing) scheduling mechanism, with best effort traffics in parallel, TSN introduces guaranteed timing behavior with focus on the transportation for Control Data traffic (CDT) under Time Aware Shaper (TAS) and audio video streams under Credit-Based Shaper (CBS). This paper introduces the basic principles of TSN standard in details, compares it with the properties of the TTEthernet standard. In particular, we first investigate their clock synchronization algorithms and discuss their shaping and scheduling strategies for traffic types with individual timing requirements. Then we show the impact the hard real-time traffic has on soft real-time traffic and give the worst case end-to-end latency calculation. Finally, we determine whether TSN offers flexibility for the requirements of avionic.

AB  - The embedded avionics system is a typical mission-critical and safety-critical system, and should ensure fulfillment of all constraints for all flows with individual timing requirements transmitted in networks. Scheduling strategies are used to meet this requirement, and different networking solutions have different approaches. AFDX (Avionics Full-DupleX Switched Ethernet) implements a SPQ (Strict Priority Queuing) scheduling strategy with two priority levels where large flow bursts from high priority data would lead to high delays for low priority flows. Ethernet-AVB (Audio Video Bridging) implements Credit-Based Shapers (CBS) on top of the SPQ mechanism, which can partly mitigate this problem. This kind of scheduling strategy could be considered in an avionics context for mix-criticality systems. In this paper, CBS and SPQ scheduling algorithms are compared especially from the worst-case criteria by using network calculus approach. Results show that compared with SPQ, CBS has a better anti-interference ability, though it would bring a bigger delay even from the worst-case prospective.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a collection of standards that extend Ethernet to support safety-critical and real-time applications. TSN integrates multiple traffic types, i.e., Time-Triggered (TT) traffic scheduled based on Gate-Control-Lists (GCLs), Audio-Video-Bridging (AVB) traffic that requires bounded latencies, and Best-Effort (BE) traffic, for which no guarantees are provided. This paper proposes a Network Calculus-based approach to determine the worst-case end-to-end delays of AVB traffic in a TSN network with both non-preemption and preemption modes. We consider the effects of TT traffic due to GCLs, "guard bands", i.e., time windows that block other traffic from transmitting, and preemption overhead on the service for AVB traffic. We provide a proof of non-overflow condition for AVB credit, which is used to control the AVB traffic transmission. The analysis method is evaluated on realistic test cases, and compared to related work.

AB  - Transforming the traffic scheduling problem of Time-sensitive networking (TSN) into a packing problem has better global optimization ability and lower algorithm complexity compared to traditional TSN communication scheduling, which can save network resources and reduce power consumption. Therefore, the paper proposes a TSN traffic scheduling algorithm based on remaining time domain using a two-dimensional packaging algorithm based on remaining space. The paper first transforms the time-triggered (TT) message scheduling problem in time sensitive networks into a two-dimensional packaging problem for research. Then, the large boxes converted from time domain are segmented, and the items are packaged into small boxes using a two-dimensional packaging algorithm based on remaining space. Finally, the small boxes are re-packed, providing a more numerous and dispersed available scheduling time period for subsequent low priority burst business flows. The simulation results show that the algorithm reduces the end-to-end average delay and jitter of sudden traffic flow, improves system stability, and reduces system power consumption while ensuring TT packet delay and jitter.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) that promises bounded delay and jitter by realizing zero congestion has been looked upon as a promising technology for delay-critical applications. Most of the prior works on TSN implicitly adopt the single path transmission. The conventional algorithms for the calculation of gate control list waste bandwidth to satisfy the constraints of time slots. In this paper, we design an SDN-based architecture, which incorporates the Concurrent Multipath Transmission (CMT) mechanism. CMT transmits the packets through multiple paths so that it can improve link utilization by realizing load balancing, and increase the number of dispatchable flows. We propose an extensible heuristic algorithm, which is Multipath Mix-Flow Scheduling (MPMFS), for flows with various QoS requirements. MPMFS dynamically schedules the flow splitting, routing, and time slot configuration of CMT. MPMFS also solves the disorder problem caused by CMT. Using the single path scheduling as the baseline, we show that the proposed architecture has a better performance on delay, jitter, resource utilization, and dispatchable flows. The simulation results also show that the algorithm execution time is linearly related to the size of delay-critical traffic.

AB  - In order to improve the conflict between real-time needs and data flow of business in smart grid, this paper proposes a scheme for optimizing traffic scheduling using time-sensitive network technology for smart grid, especially smart substations. A smart substation incorporates a switch with TSN properties to separate network traffic into time-sensitive and non-time-sensitive streams., allocate the matching time slot window for different flow, and preempt frames in the MAC layer. This scheme can reduce the queue scheduling delay of time-sensitive flow, realize the optimization of scheduling of traffic on the transmission route, and fulfill the criteria of intelligent substations by ensuring minimal delay variation and a minimal rate of data loss during the transmission of control signals and collected data.

AB  - Time Sensitive Network (TSN) is an attractive solution for time-critical frame transmission in data link layer. Traffic scheduling and shaping in TSN aim to achieve bounded low latency and zero congestion loss. TSN provides traditional frame switching with reliable Quality-of-Service (QoS) parameters, however, synchronization challenges, e.g. jitter, lost timing frames, clock inaccuracy, threaten the reliability of TSN network. Emerging Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) guarantees determinism for real-time applications, e.g. automotive and industrial control, while removing the dependence on synchronous communication. This paper focuses on performance evaluation of the recently proposed ATS amendment to the IEEE 802.1 standard, two approaches are discussed: Urgency-Based Scheduler (UBS) and Paternoster policing and scheduling. Models and simulations are carried out for evaluation and comparison. Statistics on the end-to-end delay, buffer usage and frame loss rate are collected to assess the scheduling performance. Results show that ATS achieves effective traffic shaping and switching without synchronous mechanisms, while there is an evident trade-off for using these specific algorithms.

AB  - The configuration of current automated production systems is complex and therefore time consuming while the market demands an easy setup and adaptability due to smaller batch sizes and volatile markets. While there are different concepts in research on how to simplify the engineering process by using generic skills or capabilities of devices, run-time control is still achieved with proprietary communication protocols and commands. The concept in this paper uses skills not only in the phase of engineering but also consequently for direct and generic control of field-devices. An executable skill-metamodel therefore describes the methodological functionality which is implemented by using OPC UA due to its vendor independence as well as built-in services and information model. The implementation uses client/server-based OPC UA and the pub/sub pattern to prepare for a deterministic real-time control in conjunction with TSN, which is required by industrial automation.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a task group of the IEEE 802.1 standardization working group (WG) developing the IEEE 802.1 TSN communication standards. TSN is developing a “toolbox” of many standards to provide support for enabling the separation of critical and non-critical traffic, the timeliness and dependability, i.e., reliability, fault-tolerance, and security, of critical traffic. In this paper we focus on the Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) traffic shapers, such as the original CQF, the Cycle Specified Queuing and Forwarding (CSQF) and an extension of those, the so-called Multi-CQF shaper. We define formally the problem of configuring CQF-based networks. We have developed a Constraint Programming (CP) formulation for Multi-CQF, as well as a Simulated Annealing (SA)-based metaheuristic solution. These solutions can also obtain results for CQF and CSQF, which can be seen as a special case of Multi-CQF. The CQF configuration problem is NP-hard. We evaluate our solutions on several test cases and scenarios. The CP formulation can find optimal solutions for small problem sizes but does not scale for realistic test cases. However, SA is able to handle large test cases and to find good quality solutions, making it suitable for both design-time and runtime network configuration. We also present comprehensive evaluation results comparing the CQF-based variants (CQF, CSQF, Multi-CQF) on industrial use cases, contrast them to the Time Aware Shaper (TAS, 802.1Qbv), and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

AB  - Industry 4.0 and Autonomous Driving are emerging resource-intensive distributed application domains that deal with open and evolving environments. These systems are subject to stringent resource, timing, and other non-functional constraints, as well as frequent reconfiguration. Thus, real-time behavior must not preclude operational flexibility. This combination is motivating ongoing efforts within the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) standardization committee to define admission control mechanisms for Ethernet. Existing mechanisms in TSN, like those of AVB, its predecessor, follow a distributed architecture that favors scalability. Conversely, the new mechanisms envisaged for TSN (IEEE 802.1Qcc) follow a (partially) centralized architecture, favoring short reconfiguration latency. This paper shows the first quantitative comparison between distributed and centralized admission control architectures concerning reconfiguration latency. Here, we compare AVB against a dynamic real-time reconfigurable Ethernet technology with centralized management, namely HaRTES. Our experiments show a significantly lower latency using the centralized architecture. We also observe the dependence of the distributed architecture in the end nodes' performance and the benefit of having a protected channel for the admission control transactions.

AB  - This paper presents an overview of automotive communication technologies, including related technology developments. We describe the latency of Audio Video Bridge (AVB) network as well as purpose the optimized design of the Ethernet network system for automotive. Our design plays a significant role in reducing the delay between components. The proposed approach on realistic test cases showed that there was a delay reduction, approximately 49.4%. It is expected that the optimization method for the actual automotive environment can greatly shorten the time period in the design and development process. The results obtained from the experiments on the delay time present in each function are reliable because average values are obtained through repeated actual tests for several months. It will greatly benefit the industry since analyzing the latency between each function in a short period of time is very important.

We present a design of in-vehicle network system as well as the optimization of AVB for automotive. A proposal of Reduced Latency of Machin to Machine (RLMM) plays a significant role in reducing the latency between devices. The approach of RLMM on realistic test cases indicated that there was a latency reduction about 30.41% It is expected that the optimized settings for the actual automotive network environment can greatly shorten the time period in the development and design process.

AB  - Recent trends such as automated driving in the automotive field and digitization in factory automation confront designers of real-time systems with new challenges. These challenges have arisen due to the increasing amount of data and an intensified interconnection of functions. For distributed safety-critical systems, this progression has the impact that the complexity of scheduling tasks with precedence constraints organized in so-called cause-effect chains increases the more data has to be exchanged between tasks and the more functions are involved. Especially when data has to be transmitted over an Ethernet-based communication network, the coordination between the tasks running on different end-devices and the network flows has to be ensured to meet strict end-to-end deadlines. In this work, we present an incremental heuristic approach that computes schedules for distributed and data-dependent cause-effect chains consisting of multi-rate tasks and network flows in time-sensitive networks. On the one hand, we provide a common task model for tasks and network flows. On the other hand, we introduce the concept of earliest and latest start times to speed up the solution discovery process and to discard infeasible solutions at an early stage. Our algorithm is able to solve large problems for synthetic network topologies with randomized data dependencies in a few seconds on average under strict end-to-end deadlines. We have achieved a high success rate for multi-rate cause-effect chains and an even better result for homogeneous or harmonic chains. Our approach also showed low jitter for homogeonous cause-effect chains.

AB  - The IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group has been developing various standards since 2012 to provide deterministic and time-critical services through IEEE 802 networks. The Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) is a key component in TSN that was introduced to enable precise forwarding and shaping of time-sensitive network traffic. It allows configuring exclusive transmission slots for selected traffic classes. To achieve the best benefit from the TAS, numerous scheduling algorithms have been presented to find schedules for the transmission of time-critical network streams optimizing the stream end-to-end transmission times in TAS-based networks. However, most existing works do not address how the scheduling of critical network traffic affects the necessary number of critical transmission slots that is limited in hardware and the resulting bandwidth utilization for other traffic classes. In this paper, we have investigated how a selected set of heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms for scheduling critical network streams in TAS-based networks affects the utilization of network resources, and how the configuration of TAS can be improved using a compression algorithm. Therefore, we make use of existing algorithms and propose alternatives that have an influence on input data ordering, scheduling procedures, and the TAS configuration. The evaluation showed that some of our proposed modifications can improve bandwidth utilization and reduce the number of transmission slots for critical traffic significantly. Further on, the compression algorithm can bring a remarkable improvement in isolated cases.

AB  - The functionality advancements and novel customer features that are currently found in modern automotive systems require high-bandwidth and low-latency in-vehicle communications, which become even more compelling for autonomous vehicles. In a recent effort to meet these requirements, the IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group has developed a set of standards that introduce novel features in Switched Ethernet. TSN standards offer, for example, a common notion of time through accurate and reliable clock synchronization, delay bounds for real-time traffic, time-driven transmissions, improved reliability, and much more. In order to fully utilize the potential of these novel protocols in the automotive domain, TSN should be seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art and state-of-practice model-based development processes for automotive embedded systems. Some of the core phases in these processes include software architecture modeling, timing predictability verification, simulation, and hardware realization and deployment. Moreover, throughout the development of automotive embedded systems, the safety and security requirements specified on these systems need to be duly taken into account. In this context, this work provides an overview of TSN in automotive applications and discusses the recent technological developments relevant to the adoption of TSN in automotive embedded systems. The work also points at the open challenges and future research directions.

AB  - The IEEE Audio Video Bridging (AVB) technology is nowadays under consideration in several automation domains, such as, automotive, avionics, and industrial communications. AVB offers several benefits, such as open specifications, the existence of multiple providers of electronic components, and the real-time support, as AVB provides bounded latency to real-time traffic classes. In addition to the above mentioned properties, in the automotive domain, comparing with the existing in-vehicle networks, AVB offers significant advantages in terms of high bandwidth, significant reduction of cabling costs, thickness and weight, while meeting the challenging EMC/EMI requirements. Recently, an improvement of the AVB protocol, called the AVB ST, was proposed in the literature, which allows for supporting scheduled traffic, i.e., a class of time-sensitive traffic that requires time-driven transmission and low latency. In this paper, we present a schedulability analysis for the real-time traffic crossing through the AVB ST network. In addition, we formally prove that, if the bandwidth in the network is allocated according to the AVB standard, the schedulability test based on response time analysis will fail for most cases even if, in reality, these cases are schedulable. In order to provide guarantees based on analysis test a bandwidth over-reservation is required. In this paper, we propose a solution to obtain a minimized bandwidth over-reservation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to formally spot the limitation and to propose a solution for overcoming it. The proposed analysis is applied to both the AVB standard and the AVB ST. The analysis results are compared with the results of several simulative assessments, obtained using OMNeT++, on both automotive and industrial case studies. The comparison between the results of the analysis and the simulation ones shows the effectiveness of the analysis proposed in this work.

AB  - This paper identifies a limitation in the frame preemption model in the TSN standard (IEEE 802.1Q-2018), due to which high priority frames can experience significantly long blocking delays, thereby exacerbating their worst-case response times. This limitation can have a considerable impact on the design, analysis and performance of TSN-based systems. To address this limitation, the paper presents a novel and more efficient frame preemption model in the TSN standard that allows over 90% reduction in the maximum blocking delay leading to lower worst-case response times of high priority frames compared to the frame preemption model used in the existing works. The paper also shows that the improvement becomes even more significant in multi-switch TSN networks. In order to evaluate the effects of preemption, the paper performs simulations by enabling and disabling preemptions as well as enabling and disabling the Hold/Release mechanism supported by TSN. Furthermore, the paper performs a comparative evaluation of the two models of frame preemption in TSN using simulations. The evaluation shows that the maximum response times of high priority frames can be significantly reduced with very small impact on the response times of lower priority frames. The paper also shows the improvement in the maximum response times of higher priority frames using an automotive industrial use case that employs a multi-hop TSN network for on-board communication.

AB  - This article addresses the following research question: How to compute no-wait schedules and multipath routings for large-scale time-sensitive networks (TSNs)? TSN must guarantee low latency and fault tolerance. The former requirement is achieved by sending the messages according to a no-wait schedule, whereas the latter is achieved by routing each message through multiple streams of disjoint paths. Computing such schedule and routing is an NP-hard problem. In this article, the aforementioned question is addressed by a three-fold solution: An iterated integer linear programming based scheduling (IIS) technique for scalability; the Degree of Conflict (DoC) between the IIS iterations is minimized by the DoC-aware streams partitioning (DASP) technique, which improves the success rate of the IIS; the fault-tolerance is guaranteed by a DoC-aware multipath routing technique, which integrates the DASP for further improvement in the success rate. Two hundred synthetic test cases are used for performance evaluation. The proposed method scales well, i.e., it handled networks of 21 bridges and 480 messages under 40 min timeout. The success rate of the highly utilized instances raised from 47% by random streams partitioning to 90% by the proposed method.

AB  - Current safety-critical applications, found in domains such as automotive networking, automated industries, and control systems, require deterministic and latency-bounded end-to-end communication, currently not supported by best-effort networks. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is the most feasible approach to fulfill such requirements. Originating from the wired domain, their application to the wireless domain is now attracting attention. Besides some advances in time synchronization and scheduling, essential policies such as association with a wireless TSN (W-TSN), have not been explored. This paper analyses the necessary tools for a prospective client to accomplish association with the W-TSN without affecting ongoing time-sensitive traffic. We introduce three beacon-based methods to pre-synchronize and pre-schedule nodes willing to associate with the network. On top of the first full-stack Software Defined Radio (SDR) based IEEE802.11/Wi-Fi design, the proposed approaches are developed and tested in a real-world environment. A delay analysis shows a worst-case association delay of up to 1.8 s, and high accuracy synchronization on prospective clients' association frame receptions, with 100% of on-time arrivals, even with challenging scheduling timeslots as short as 128 mu\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\upmu$$\end{document}s.

AB  - In this paper we are interested in real-time control applications that are implemented using Fog Computing Platforms consisting of interconnected heterogeneous Fog Nodes (FNs). Similar to previous research and ongoing standardization efforts, we assume that the communication between FNs is achieved via the IEEE 802.1 Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) standard. We model the control applications as a set of real-time flows, and we assume that the messages are transmitted using scheduled traffic that is using the Gate Control Lists (GCLs) in TSN. Given a network topology and a set of control applications, we are interested to synthesize the GCLs for messages such that the Quality-of-Control (QoC) of control applications is maximized and the deadlines of real-time messages are satisfied. We have proposed a Constraint Programming (CP)-based solution to this problem, and developed an accurate analytical model for QoC, which, together with a metaheuristic search employed in the CP solver can drive the search quickly towards good quality solutions. We have evaluated the proposed strategy on several test cases including realistic test cases and also validate the resulted GCLs on a TSN hardware platform and via simulations in OMNET++.

AB  - Networks are a core element of many industrial and automation systems at present. Often these networks transport time- and safety-critical messages that control physical processes. Thus, timely and guaranteed delivery is an essential property of networks for such critical systems. Over the past decade, a variety of network solutions have evolved to satisfy said properties. However, these solutions are largely incompatible with each other and many system architects are forced to deploy different solutions in parallel due to their different capabilities. IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a standardization group that enhances IEEE networking standards, most prominently Ethernet-based networks, with said properties and has the unique potential to evolve as a cross-industry mainstream networking technology. In this survey paper, we give an overview of TSN in industrial communication and automation systems and discuss specific TSN standards and projects in detail as well as their applicability to various industries.

AB  - In this work, we present and analyze methods and mechanisms for interconnecting a network slice control and management system of the mobile network, with an IEEE Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) control plane. IEEE TSN is gaining momentum as a key technology that is able to provide network service guarantees for Ethernet-based communications. Although Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) have been thoroughly investigated in 5G, incorporating TSN technologies in the Transport Network is expected to unleash the potential of end-to-end deterministic communications, especially in industrial environments and time-critical applications like factory automation.We elaborate on the concepts of a TSN-aware Xhaul network, present a novel architecture, and describe a set of amendments required in order to enable network slicing. With the devised approach, a slice-aware TSN-enabled transport network can be controlled and managed in an end-to-end orchestrated way. Implementation experience and evaluation results are reported using TSN-enabled prototype devices, OpenAirInterface (OAI), and JOX slice orchestrator.

AB  - This paper presents SPHERE, a project aimed at the realization of an integrated framework to abstract the hardware complexity of interconnected, modern system-on-chips (SoC) and simplify the management of their heterogeneous computational resources. The SPHERE framework leverages hypervisor technology to virtualize computational resources and isolate the behavior of different subsystems running on the same platform, while providing safety, security, and real-time communication mechanisms. The main challenges addressed by SPHERE are discussed in the paper along with a set of new technologies developed in the context of the project. They include isolation mechanisms for mixed-criticality applications, predictable I/O virtualization, the management of time-sensitive networks with heterogeneous traffic flows, and the management of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) to provide efficient implementations for cryptography modules, as well as hardware acceleration for deep neural networks. The SPHERE architecture is validated through an autonomous driving use-case.

Different from mechanisms described in the literature and standardization for deterministic delay aggregation, a novel method using a time window combined with a timeout-based approach is proposed. The goal is to achieve bounded delay aggregation of traffic suitable for application in fronthaul transport. We propose an asynchronous approach to deterministic networking, enabling bounded delay transmission (BDT). Exploration of parameters for controlling the maximum delay and packet delay variation (PDV) of the aggregated traffic is performed by simulation, and practical demonstration is shown in an experiment. Using the proposed mechanisms, we show that the delay and PDV can be bounded below 20 μs with up to 85%–90% carried load of the aggregated flows. Hence, we demonstrate their suitability for delay sensitive fronthaul transport and future applications in 5G networking. Experimental results demonstrate that the practical implementation of the mechanism is viable. Thus, it motivates the extensive analysis performed through simulations.

AB  - The revolution that Industrial Control Systems are undergoing is reshaping the traditional network management and it is introducing new challenges. After the advent of network virtualization, an enhanced level of automation has been required to cope with the safety-critical mission of industrial systems and strict requirements for end-to-end latency. In the literature, there have been attempts to automatically solve two strictly interconnected problems for the management of virtual industrial networks: the Virtual Network Function embedding and the time-sensitive flow scheduling problems. However, dealing with these problems separately can lead to unoptimized results, or in the worst case to situations where the latency requirements cannot be satisfied because of a poorly chosen function embedding. In light of these motivations, this paper proposes a formal approach to jointly solve the two problems through an Optimization Satisfiability Modulo Theories formulation. This choice also allows combining two vital features: a formal guarantee of the solution correctness and optimization targeting the minimization of the end-to-end delay for flow scheduling. The feasibility of the proposed approach has been validated by implementing a prototype framework and experimentally testing it on realistic use cases.

AB  - Time-sensitive networks (TSNs) provide reliable, deterministic message delivery, ideal for networked control systems. Such networks are increasingly implemented in dynamic, resource-constrained avionics environments. This places pressure on the TSN scheduler to compute network flow schedules faster with slower processors, less memory, and limited power consumption. Avionics full-duplex switched Ethernet and IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking are briefly compared and found to be largely similar in concept except for mechanisms enforcing determinism (BAG versus IEEE 802.1Qbv gate control) and the added requirement for time synchronization in time-sensitive networking. A new form of reliability known as polymorphic reconfiguration is introduced and contrasted with static, preconfigured redundancy. Scalability issues impacting TSN scheduling for polymorphic reconfiguration are derived. Preconfiguring and storing the TSN schedule for every possible network failure is infeasible in terms of memory storage. IEEE 802.1CB and other redundancy mechanisms exacerbate the problem by further increasing the number of flows that have to be reconfigured and scheduled. The computational complexity of TSN scheduling is reviewed and the notion of a processing-storage tradeoff via a schedule seed is introduced. The resource constrained scheduling challenge is addressed by analyzing tradeoffs in efficient scheduling approaches where qualitative performance metrics are inferred, high-level computational methods are compared, and suggestions for future approaches are outlined. This article contributes to time-sensitive networking scheduling capable of operating in a resource-constrained, dynamically changing network environment rather than in fixed avionics network environments to which they are limited today. Finally, the need for standards for TSN scheduling performance profiling and benchmarks as well as partial schedules and distributed TSN scheduling protocol standards is highlighted.

AB  - During the digital transformation process of the society, emerging industry applications with critical data streams present great challenges to current networks. Traditional Ethernet provides best-effort frame delivery service without any performance guarantee such as latency and frame loss. Industrial Ethernet provides real-time and reliable communication services for industrial automation systems. However, the standards of industrial Ethernet are not compatible with each other, and the networking of different industrial systems becomes a great challenge. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) based on Ethernet provides high-quality multi-service flow transmissions on the same network through enhanced functions of time synchronization, deterministic flow scheduling and seamless reliability. It enables high-reliable and bounded low-latency flow transmission services. It is one of the key networking technologies for vertical applications such as industrial automation systems, in-vehicle networking, smart grid, and so on. Firstly, this survey introduces the standardization status of TSN from the following five aspects: time synchronization, low-latency flow control, reliability, network control and management, and use cases. The problems and key technologies of these standards are analyzed. For example,Time synchronization protocols such as NTP (Network Time Protocol),PTP (Precise Time Protocol), and gPTP (generalized PTP) are introduced and compared with a focus on the synchronization algorithms. Different flow scheduling mechanisms covered in the standards are described, analyzed, and compared qualitatively, based on their characteristics and performances. Network redundancy scheme based on the frame replication and elimination for reliability (FRER) is introduced in detail. Three models of TSN control and management are presented. They are centralized model,distributed model, and hybrid model. Vertical applications of TSN are briefly outlined including: professional audio and video,industrial automation, mobile fronthaul,service provider network, in-vehicle networking, and smart grid. Secondly, we survey the research state-of-the-art of TSN with a focus on the advantages and disadvantages of current solutions. Three research areas covered in this survey are time synchronization, flow control, and reliability. The main challenges to time synchronizations are algorithms enabling fast and efficient synchronization process,and clock precision. Current research works on the low-latency flow control mainly focus on traffic shaping, traffic scheduling, and traffic preemption. Traffic shaping problems include delay analysis,shaping mechanism and shaping overhead. Research topics of traffic scheduling include optimization algorithms, joint scheduling of routing and slot allocation, and software defined TSN. Flow preemption research works try to solve the problems of jitter and the adversary effect to the preempted traffic flow. Research works on TSN reliability include redundancy mechanisms,fault detection and restoration,and reliability of time synchronizations. Finally, research challenges and potential research directions are discussed. Future research works include TSN networking, Wireless TSN, and vertical applications of TSN. How to integrate TSN with other network layers remains to be a research problem. Due to the inherent characteristics of wireless channels, design of wireless networks with deterministic properties similar to TSN is a great challenge. Vertical applications of TSN such as 5G fronthaul, industrial automation systems, and in-vehicle networking are envisioned. In a word, TSN is a promising network technology in the fourth industrial revolution of the society.

AB  - In the high-tech and automotive industry, bandwidth considerations and widely accepted standardization are two important reasons why Ethernet is currently being considered as an alternative solution for real-time communication (compared to traditional fieldbusses). Although Ethernet was originally not intended for this purpose, the development of the Ethernet AVB standard enables its use for transporting high-volume data (e.g. from cameras and entertainment applications) with low-latency guarantees. In complex industrial systems, the network is shared by many applications, developed by different parties. To face this complexity, the development of these applications must be kept as independent as possible. In particular, from a network point of view, progress of all communication streams must be guaranteed, and the performance for individual streams should be predictable using only information regarding the stream under study and the general parameters of the communication standard used by the network. Initial methods to guarantee latency for Ethernet AVB networks rely on the traditional busy-period analysis. Typically, these methods are based on knowledge of the inter-arrival patterns of both the stream under study and the interfering streams that also traverse the network. The desired independence is therefore not achieved. In this paper, we present an independent real-time analysis based on so-called eligible intervals, which does not rely on any assumptions on interfering priority classes other than those enforced in the Ethernet AVB standard. We prove this analysis is tight in case there is only a single higher-priority stream, and no additional information on interference is known. In case there are multiple higher-priority streams, we give conditions under which the analysis is still tight. Furthermore, we compare the results of our approach to the two most recent busy-period analyses, point out sources of pessimism in these earlier works, and argue that assuming more information on the sources of interference (e.g. a minimal inter-arrival time between interfering frames) has only limited advantages.

AB  - This paper deals with the integration of lane keeping assistance (LKA) and direct yaw-moment control (DYC) for smart four-wheel-independent-drive electric vehicles (FWID-EVs) using a new central-zonal electronic and electrical (E/E) architecture with multi-path asynchronization (MPA) loop delays. The central-zonal E/E architecture with grouped components by their physical positions in the vehicle results significant improvement of computing power, data transmission and harness simplification. However, the MPA loop delays in the central-zonal E/E architecture may degrade or even deteriorate the stability of the system. Firstly, a new analysis model on the MPA loop delays is constructed to describe the network-induced delays. A mathematical upper-bound equation is derived to determine the worst-case loop delays. Secondly, in order to deal with the MPA loop delays and simplify the robust controller design, a novel co-design method of control and scheduling is proposed, in which a time-sensitive networking (TSN) with flexible time-triggered scheduling (FTTS) scheme is developed for improving the communication effectiveness, and a model predictive control (MPC) is adopted to make decisions instantly for improving the control accuracy. Furthermore, a Lyapunov-based pole assignment theory is applied to verify the system stability. Finally, the results of the Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) experiment validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a new set of amendments that guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of time-critical and safety-critical Ethernet applications. The guard band mechanism prevents time-sensitive traffic from colliding with non-time-sensitive traffic, causing potential bandwidth waste. Moreover, most of the existing scheduling strategies only consider Audio Video Bridging (AVB) traffic and Time-Triggered (TT) traffic, resulting in Best Effort (BE) traffic not being scheduled de facto. This article proposes a new system design and scheduling strategy for TSN switches. The size-aware group weighted round robin (SGWRR) strategy is proposed to schedule AVB queues according to subperiods, reducing the average scheduling intervals of the AVB frames. The entire scheduling cycle is divided into a protected slot and an unprotected slot, and dynamic programming is used to minimize guard band waste. An old queue priority (OQP) strategy is also proposed to provide scheduling opportunities for BE queues. A simulation of OMNet++ shows that SGWRR can achieve low average scheduling intervals while improving bandwidth utilization by 5.66% and that OQP can enhance BE scheduling opportunities by 21.9% under our experimental conditions compared with existing methods.

AB  - To make manufacturers more intelligent in the production of cyber-physical systems (CPS), the IEEE 802.1 working group proposes a Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) standard based on traditional Ethernet. TSN can help the industrial environment to realize intelligent real-time transmission requirements. At present, the research on TSN focuses mainly on how to optimize the scheduling table synthesis to reduce the end-to-end delay of the frame. Routing selection typically uses the common shortest path first (SPF) and weighted shortest path first (wtSPF) algorithms. The path chosen by these algorithms can only ensure a low end-to-end delay of newly added streams, but they cannot guarantee the success rate of scheduling newly added streams or determine whether the delay will have a serious impact on other streams. Therefore, this paper proposes a scheduling routing algorithm for the TSN environment, named Real-Time Routing Scheduler (RTRS), which is applicable to Time-Triggered (TT) streams with immediate constraints. Based on the calculation of the end-to-end maximum delay time, the RTRS is used as a basis for routing to ensure that all TT streams are transmitted within the deadline. The experimental results show that the RTRS algorithm can provide an excellent real-time performance of CPS, improve the scheduling success rate, optimize the maximum end-to-end delay, and ensure that newly added streams do not easily affect the transmission of other streams.

AB  - This paper considers a MIMO multi-hop network and analyzes the relationship between its energy consumption and bandwidth efficiency. Its minimum energy consumption is formulated as an optimization problem. By taking both transmit antennas (TAs) and receive antennas (RAs) into consideration, the energy-bandwidth efficiency tradeoff in the networks is investigated. Moreover, the minimum energy of an equally-spaced relaying strategy is investigated for various numbers of antennas. In addition, the minimum energy over all possible antenna pairs is derived. Finally, the effect of the number of hops on the energy-bandwidth efficiency tradeoff is considered. For a fixed antenna pair, the minimum energy over all possible rates and hop numbers are obtained. Generally, the routes with more hops minimize the energy consumption in the low effective rate region. On the other hand, in the high effective rate region, the routes with fewer hops minimize the energy consumption.

AB  - Aiming at high performance, more and more Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) adopt Multiprocessor System-on-Chips (MPSoCs) as computation units. However, due to increasing integration of transistors on a die, the power densities together with performance variations of MPSoC chips have been increasing dramatically. Consequently, the MPSoC-based CPSs might become unsustainable and unreliable. Although various Task Allocation and Scheduling (TAS) heuristics have been proposed to minimize the hotspot time (i.e., duration of thermal emergency) and energy consumption of MPSoC designs, few of them can guarantee the highest performance yield under process variations without violating energy, thermal and timing constraints. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel energy- and thermal-aware TAS evaluation and optimization framework. Based on statistical model checking techniques, our approach enables accurate modeling and reasoning of the performance yield of real-time MPSoC designs under joint energy and thermal constraints. To enable system-level design space exploration, we propose a regression analysis-based method that can drastically reduce the overall exploration efforts. Experimental results show that our fully-automated approach can not only allow accurate sustainability-oriented reasoning of TAS solutions under specified thermal and energy constraints, but also enable the quick search of optimal TAS solutions on different MPSoC architectures with the highest performance yield.

AB  - With the development of real-time critical systems, the ever-increasing communication data traffic puts forward high-bandwidth and low-delay requirements for communication networks. Therefore, various real-time Ethernet protocols have been proposed, but these protocols are not compatible with each other. The IEEE 802.1 Working Group developed standardized protocols named Audio Video Bridging (AVB) in 2005, and renamed it Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) later. TSN not only adds new features but also retains the original functions of AVB. Proposing real-time Ethernet modeling and design methodologies is the key to meeting high-bandwidth and low-delay communication requirements. This article surveys the modeling from AVB to TSN, mainly including: (1) AVB and TSN modeling; (2) end-to-end delay modeling; (3) real-time scheduling modeling; (4) reliability modeling; and (5) security modeling. Based on these models, this article surveys the recent advances in real-time Ethernet design methodologies from AVB to TSN: (1) end-to-end delay analysis from AVB to TSN; (2) real-time scheduling from AVB to TSN; (3) reliability-aware design for TSN; and (4) security-aware design for TSN. Among the above four points, the last two points are only for TSN, because AVB lacks reliability and security mechanisms. This article further takes the automotive use case as an example to discuss the application of TSN in automobiles. Finally, this article discusses the future trends of TSN. By surveying the recent advances and future trends, we hope to provide references for researchers interested in real-time Ethernet modeling and design methodologies for AVB and TSN.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) realizes high bandwidth and time determinism for data transmission and thus becomes the crucial communication technology in time-critical systems. The Gate Control List (GCL) is used to control the transmission of different classes of traffic in TSN, including Time-Triggered (TT) flows, Audio-Video-Bridging (AVB) flows, and Best-Effort (BE) flows. Most studies focus on optimizing GCL synthesis by reserving the preceding time slots to serve TT flows with the strict delay requirement, but ignore the deadlines of non-TT flows and cause the large delay. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive scheduling method to enhance the real-time scheduling of AVB flows while guaranteeing the time determinism of TT flows. This method first optimizes GCL synthesis to reserve the preceding time slots for AVB flows, and then introduces the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) method to further improve the transmission of AVB flows by considering their deadlines. Moreover, the worst-case delay (WCD) analysis method is proposed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the transmission of AVB flows compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - The seven articles in this special section focus on time sensitive networking (TSN), an IEEE 802.1 standard. TSN makes it possible to carry data traffic of time-critical and/or mission- critical applications over a bridged Ethernet network shared by various kinds of applications having different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, i.e., time and/or mission critical TSN traffic and non-TSN best effort traffic. TSN provides guaranteed data transport with bounded low latency, low delay variation, and extremely low data loss for time and/or mission critical traffic. By reserving resources for critical traffic, and applying various queuing and shaping techniques, TSN achieves zero congestion loss for critical data traffic. This, in turn, allows TSN to guarantee a worst-case end-to-end latency for critical data. TSN also provides ultra-reliability for data traffic via a data packet level reliability mechanism as well as protection against bandwidth violation, malfunctioning, malicious attacks, etc. TSN includes reliable time synchronization, a profile of IEEE 1588, which provides the basis for many other TSN functions.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an industry-standard networking protocol that is widely deployed in safety-critical industrial and automotive networks thanks to its quality-of-service (QoS) mechanisms, esp. deterministic transmission and bounded end-to-end delay for time-triggered (TT) flows. In this article, we focus on TT flows and address the issue of fault tolerance against permanent and transient faults with both spatial and temporal redundancy. We present an efficient heuristic algorithm for online incremental rerouting and rescheduling of disrupted flows, assuming the paths and schedules of existing flows stay fixed. It is complementary to and can be combined with offline routing and scheduling algorithms for achieving fault tolerance based on frame replication and elimination for reliability (FRER) (IEEE 802.1CB). Performance evaluation shows that our approach is able to better recover the system’s degree of redundancy (DoR) and has a higher acceptance rate than related work.

AB  - TSN has become the most popular technique in modern safety-critical automotive and industrial automation networks by providing deterministic transmission policies. However, the data of TSN messages may be affected by transient faults. IEEE 802.1CB, a reliability standard in TSN, protects against such faults by providing disjoint redundant routes for each stream. However, the unique assumption may present a new challenge, i.e., an inadequate number of redundant routes that may negatively impact stream scheduling. This article presents an offline fault-tolerant TSN scheduling approach that considers such impacts for real-time streams (such as time-trigger (TT) and audio video bridging (AVB) streams). Specifically, we intend to calculate the minimum upper bound number of disjoint routes required for each stream to meet the reliability requirements, subsequently enhancing the network’s schedulability. We also propose a service degradation function for AVB streams when the network is under heavy load caused by redundant transmissions of TT streams. This function will maintain schedulability and reliability for AVB streams. Experiments with small- and large-scale synthetic networks show the efficiency.

AB  - The production, manipulation and exploitation of future visions are increasingly important elements in practices of visioneering socio-technical processes of innovation and transformation. This becomes obvious in new and emerging science and technologies and large-scale transformations of established socio-technical systems (e.g. the energy system). A variety of science and technology studies (STS) provide evidence on correlations between expectations and anticipatory practices with the dynamics of such processes of change. Technology assessment (TA) responded to the challenges posed by the influence of visions on the processes by elaborating methodologies for a "vision assessment" as a contribution to what is now increasingly known as "hermeneutical TA". But until now, the practical functions of visions in the processes have not been explained in a way that satisfies the empirical needs of TA's vision assessment-that is to provide future-oriented knowledge based on the analysis of ongoing changes in the present without knowing the future outcomes. Our leading hypothesis is that we can only understand the practical roles of visions in current processes if we analyse them as socio-epistemic practices which simultaneously produce new knowledge and enable new social arrangements. We elaborate this by means of two cases: the visions of In Vitro meat and of the smart grid. Here, we interpret visioneering more in its collective dimension as a contingent and open-ended process, emerging from heterogeneous socio-epistemic practices. This paper aims at improving TA's vision assessments and related STS research on visionary practices for real-time analysis and assessments.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of worst-case timing analysis of extended Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) networks, incorporating Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) shapers called Burst Limiting Shapers (BLS), to enable the interconnection of different avionics domains with mixed-criticality levels, e.g., current AFDX traffic, Flight Control and In-Flight Entertainment. Conducting such an analysis is a challenging issue when considering multiple BLS-shaped traffic classes, due to the sophisticated inter-dependencies between the different shapers sharing the same output capacity. We tackle this problem through extending the applicability domain of our previous work for computing maximum delay bounds using Network Calculus and considering only one BLS class, called Continuous Credit-based Approach (CCbA), to handle multiple TSN/BLS classes. We provide further insights into the sensitivity and tightness issues of worst-case delay bounds yielded with the Generalized CCbA (GCCbA). Our assessments show that the tightness ratio is up to 85%, with reference to Achievable Worst-Case delays. We also show the improvements against recent state-of-the-art approaches in terms of tightness and complexity, where the computation time is up to 105 faster. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of GCCbA for realistic avionics case studies, e.g., adding A350 flight control traffic to the AFDX. Results show the good applicability of GCCbA and confirm the efficiency of the extended AFDX, which decreases the delay bounds of the existing AFDX traffic by up to 49.9%, in comparison with the current AFDX standard.

AB  - The class of Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS) includes cyber-physical systems leveraging on self-x technologies that make them capable to learn, adapt to changes, and reason under uncertainties in possibly critical applications and evolving environments. In the last decade, there has been a growing interest in enabling artificial intelligence technologies, such as advanced machine learning, new threats, such as adversarial attacks, and certification challenges, due to the lack of sufficient explainability. However, in order to be trustworthy, those systems also need to be dependable, secure, and resilient according to well-established taxonomies, methodologies, and tools. Therefore, several aspects need to be addressed for TAS, ranging from proper taxonomic classification to the identification of research opportunities and challenges. Given such a context, in this paper address relevant taxonomies and research perspectives in the field of TAS. We start from basic definitions and move towards future perspectives, regulations, and emerging technologies supporting development and operation of TAS.

AB  - In the era of the Internet of Everything, the burst of traffic will bring many problems. Traffic shaping, as a common means to limit burst traffic rate, achieves “peak and valley reduction” to smooth the output rate, avoid network congestion, guarantee the quality of service (QoS) and improve the overall network transmission efficiency. This paper first explains the basic concept of traffic shaping, the related algorithms in traffic shaping, and compares the differences between traffic shaping and traffic policing. It then describes the research on traffic shaping in software-defined networks and the results from the combination of the two. This is followed by an introduction to relatively new technology for industry, time-sensitive networks, and an exploration of the functions of various types of traffic shapers in time-sensitive networks. This is followed by a description of case studies of traffic shaping in IoT scenarios and an overview of these traffic shaping schemes, summarizing the usefulness of the shaping schemes. Finally, the future of traffic shaping is explored.

AB  - To improve the experience of real-time interactive applications based on video and audio, there is a growing demand to realize deterministic networks that can transmit these media with low latency. In recent years, various deterministic network technologies have been studied such as Time Sensitive Networking (TSN). Time slot allocation type schemes such as Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) offer guaranteed delayed determinism and zero-jitter, but suffer from low network accommodation efficiency. Shaper-based techniques such as Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) provide high network accommodation efficiency and delay determinism inside the network. However, if the input traffic from the sender is bursty, End-to-End delay increases due to the shaping delay caused by the shapers at the edges of the network. In this paper, we propose Delay-Based Shaper (DBS), which dynamically controls the bandwidth while shaping the bursts so that the upper bound of the shaping delay is protected. In addition, we also propose a Dynamic Token Bucket Algorithm (DTBA) that extends the conventional token bucket algorithm to implement DBS. We show that DBS can both shape bursts and comply with the upper bound of shaping delay by comparing the behavior when bursts are input via a conventional shaper. We also demonstrate good End-to-End delay determinism and high network accommodation efficiency by applying DBS to the edge of the network.

AB  - IEEE 802.1 time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a set of amendments to the IEEE 802.1 standard that enable safety-critical and real-time behavior over Ethernet for the industrial automation and automotive domains. Selected TSN mechanisms offer the possibility to emulate the well-known traffic classes found in mixed-criticality distributed systems: Time-triggered (TT) communication with low jitter and bounded endto-end latency, audio-video-bridging (AVB) streams with bounded end-to-end latency, and general besteffort messages, which have no timing guarantees. Critical traffic is guaranteed via the global network schedule which is stored in so-called gate control lists (GCLs) and controls the timely behavior of frames for each queue of an egress port. Although researchers have started to propose approaches for the routing and scheduling (i.e., GCL synthesis) of TT traffic, all previous research has ignored lower priority realtime traffic, such as AVB, resulting in TT configurations that may increase the worst-case delays of AVB traffic, rendering it unschedulable. In this paper, we propose a joint routing and scheduling approach for TT traffic, which takes into account the AVB traffic, such that both TT and the AVB traffic are schedulable. We extensively evaluate our approach on a number of synthetic and realistic test cases.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an exponential growth of IoT (Internet of Things) devices in the market and increasingly, they are being part of critical mission functionalities for many industries. For this reason, processes associated with these devices are generating new requirements at the level of interconnectivity, security, and scalability. Due to the large volume of devices, this growth process has tested the existing communications infrastructure, deployment architecture, different support services, technical requirements and the intrinsic characteristics of the services offered. In this sense, the use of Edge Computing schemes and TSN (Time-Sensitive Networking), is proposed as a tool for supporting IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) services to achieve optimization and assurance processes of latency, scalability and interoperability parameters required by critical mission services such as health, transportation and production. In this sense, we propose several strategies for assuring low latency, scalability and interoperability in Edge Computing and TSN networks for critical IIoT services. These strategies are evaluated considering different levels of congestion and considering different schemes such as best effort, TSN and Edge Computing.

AB  - The next generation of industrial wireless networking is expected to integrate the capabilities of time-sensitive networking (TSN), providing deterministic communication for industrial applications within wireless domain. Fifth generation (5G) systems integrate with TSN as a logical bridge to the TSN domain, supporting the coexistence of different traffic classes, such as periodic traffic, sporadic traffic, and mobile broadband traffic. However, to simultaneously satisfy the bounded latency requirements of time-critical TSN services and the bandwidth requirements of nontime-critical 5G services, it is required to accurately schedule the data flows and efficiently allocate resources. In this article, we investigate resource slicing of the radio access network (RAN) in 5G-TSN integration and some of the relevant related aspects. Particularly, we first introduce the background of TSN, 5G-TSN integration, and RAN slicing. Then, the implementation of deterministic communication is briefly reviewed. Next, a RAN slicing framework based on an artificial intelligence (AI)-engine deployed in the fog node is presented for enabling the transmission of the deterministic and non-deterministic traffic flows. Last, an AI-based resource scheduling method for the RAN of 5G-TSN integration is proposed, and simulations are carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed method.

AB  - For many Ethernet-based real-time systems, such as those from automotive, avionics, and industry automation domains, fault tolerance is emerged as an essential requirement for enabling fail-safe or fail-operational behavior. Consequently, the IEEE 802.1CB-2017 standard was published. It is currently the only available time-sensitive networking group standard offering protection against transmission errors. It tackles these faults by preventively replicating the frames and transmitting redundant copies via different paths to the destination. However, in contrast to its obvious advantages, the standard contains some pitfalls: most notably, it lacks protection mechanisms against inadequate configurations, which can not only invalidate the intended increase in reliability but even actively jeopardize the safety of the network. Due to the lack of alternative mechanisms, it is crucial to fully understand the fundamental properties of the standard and its implications on the safety aspects of the network traffic. In this letter, we identify critical aspects and limitations of the standard. We demonstrate the risks of inadequate configurations, discuss their ramifications. Finally, we provide an intuition and initial steps toward deriving the formal worst-case timing analysis of the standard, which is a key requirement for its safe and efficient implementation in the aforementioned real-time domains.

AB  - In this paper, we identify that the existing end-to-end data propagation delay analysis for distributed embedded systems can calculate pessimistic (over-estimated) analysis results when the nodes are synchronized. This is particularly the case of the Scheduled Traffic (ST) class in Time-sensitive Networking (TSN), which is scheduled offline according to the IEEE 802.1Qbv standard and the nodes are synchronized according to the IEEE 802.1AS standard. We present a comprehensive system model for distributed embedded systems that incorporates all of the above mentioned aspect as well as all traffic classes in TSN. We extend the analysis to support both synchronization and non-synchronization among the ECUs as well as offline schedules on the networks. The extended analysis can now be used to analyze all traffic classes in TSN when the nodes are synchronized without introducing any pessimism in the analysis results. We evaluate the proposed model and the extended analysis on a vehicular industrial use case.

AB  - A delay mathematical model was constructed,which combined the classical AVB (Audio/Video Bridge)protocol model and QLearning with the objective of AVB switch's data to improve the compactness of AVB data delay analysis results.Based on the study of the AVB protocol model and Qreinforcement learning theory,a more practical forwarding strategy was proposed for AVB switch data.The delay of each frame and the average delay of all types of traffic were analyzed based on factors influencing the data forwarding delay of automotive Ethernet.To verify the correctness of the established mathematical model,a simulation test bench of automotive Ethernet was built by combining Intrepid's RAD_Galaxy and the samples of the surround view system,and the experimental results were compared and analyzed based on Wireshark analysis.The simulation of the surround view system and the testing results of simulation test bench indicate the following:under a given condition,the average delay of class A flow is 41.36mus,and the maximum deviation is 3.17%;the average delay of class BE flow is 103.53mus,and the maximum deviation is 2.01%;the average delay of class BE flow is 141.99 mus,and the maximum deviation is 3.14%.At the same time,under different loads of BE flow, the delay performances of all types of data are also different.When the link load increases,the average delay of A and B data frames also increases,whereas the average delay of BE data frames does not change significantly.However,when the load exceeds the bandwidth,the average delay of the BE data frames becomes very large.That is,the protocol guarantees the transmission quality of data frames A and B.In addition,the maximum deviation of the delay analysis based on this mathematical model of the simulation test bench is 3.11%,which verifies the reliability of the mathematical model.Therefore,the model can effectively evaluate and guide improvements in network performance.

AB  - In order to more accurately analyze the problem of time delay simulation and calculation in the time-sensitive network (TSN) of vehicular Ethernet, a TSN reservation class data delay analysis model improved based on the State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the TSN data queue forwarding delay model and reservation class data delay analysis intelligent body model are established, then the TSN traffic scheduling mechanism is improved by the SARSA reinforcement learning algorithm, and the improved TSN network reservation class data analysis model is established for the uncertainty of traffic scheduling in the network; finally, the fitting performance of the proposed method is verified by simulation and experimental validation. The results show that the deviation between the two is less than 5% under different BE loads, i.e., the established reservation class data delay analysis model is able to correctly fit the scheduling mechanism of the vehicle-mounted TSN network, which proves the reasonableness of the model simulation.

AB  - The emerging time-critical applications, such as industrial automation, smart grids, and telesurgery, pose strong demands for enabling end-to-end time-sensitive and deterministic networks. However, most of the existing research only considers the time-sensitive network in the layer 2 local area, or separately designs the deterministic network in the layer 3 wide area. The feasibility of end-to-end scheduling has been largely ignored. Moreover, the problem of multi-layer deterministic architecture design and cross-domain resource co-scheduling have not been fully considered. Therefore, this article proposes a novel architecture named C-TSDN, in which the cyclic queuing and forwarding mechanism and the cycle-specified queuing and forwarding mechanism are jointly designed to solve the bandwidth, cycle, and queue mismatch problems in end-to-end scheduling. The key functional modules of the proposed C-TSDN are detailed, including SRv6, network slicing, cycle alignment, and global computing. We elaborately exhibit the promising technical challenges, such as traffic analysis with AI. Finally, some potential open issues as future research directions are pointed out.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is emerging to support critical real-time applications in Industry 4.0. Recent proposals leverage Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) to achieve bounded-delay transmission for cyclic flows in TSN. However, the CQF is not flexible enough in two aspects. First, it cannot achieve zero jitter. The Ping-Pong queue-based model in CQF will introduce the jitter of two cycles, which is inapplicable to industrial automation scenarios where isochronous flows require zero jitter. Second, it may require setting the maximum queue length to a fixed value in advance and scheduling the flows offline, which is challenging for dynamic traffic scheduling. In this paper, we firstly present a time-aware cyclic-queuing (TACQ) mechanism to enable zero jitter for CQF. TACQ consists of a novel no-wait shaper (NWS) and a cyclic-queuing shaper (CQS). The NWS handles isochronous flows by strictly limiting the transmission time of flows that do not overlap on each output port and each period. The CQS is extended from CQF to schedule cyclic flows. Then, we propose a variable time slot mechanism and a novel incremental routing and scheduling (IRAS) algorithm based on software-defined networking (SDN) to online schedule dynamic flows. Simulation results show that TACQ significantly reduces the delay of isochronous flows and achieves zero jitter compared with CQF. And the IRAS algorithm approaches 96.1% of the optimal solution in scheduling 2000 flows with a feasible per-flow computational time.

AB  - Time-sensitive software-defined networking (TSSDN) is an emerging technology that combines the real-time network configuration capabilities of software-defined networking (SDN) with the deterministic flow delivery capabilities of time-sensitive networking (TSN), making it ideal for use in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, as data flows generated by industrial applications grow exponentially, it is challenging to achieve low-latency and reliable data flow transmission at the same time in TSSDN due to the limited network resources. To address this issue, we propose the adoption of the frame replication and elimination for reliability (FRER) mechanism in TSSDN-based IIoT systems. However, it is important to acknowledge that the FRER mechanism introduces stress on the already restricted network resources by generating redundant paths. In light of this concern, we construct an end-to-end delay bound model and a reliability model to analyze this issue. To mitigate the stress imposed on the network, we formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the overall system utility while adhering to the transmission requirements of business flows and the limitations of hardware resources. Consequently, we devise an algorithm for reliability-enhanced flow routing and scheduling, which effectively solves the aforementioned optimization problem. To validate the effectiveness and performance of our proposed algorithm, we conduct numerical simulations on four data sets. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing methods.

AB  - Based on the communication requirements of IEC 61850 smart substation services and the basic principle of timesensitive networking (TSN), TSN technology is applied to ensure the real-time characteristic of substation communication services. The information flow service curve is established based on the switch forwarding principle of the TSN flow scheduling protocol IEEE 802.1Qbv. Based on the packet transmission characteristics of the substation communication network, the arrival curve of the information source is established, and a calculation method of the end-to-end maximum time delay of the substation packet transmission is proposed by using the network calculus theory. Through the simulation analysis of different levels of substation communication network, the results show that TSN technology meets the communication requirement of substation services, especially in ensuring the real-time transmission of time-sensitive services such as key control commands. The proposed maximum time delay calculation method provides a theoretical calculation basis for time delay analysis of applying TSN to smart substations.

AB  - Time sensitive networks support deterministic schedules over Ethernet networks. Due to their high determinism, high reliability and high bandwidth, they have been considered as a good choice for the backbone network of industrial internet of things. In industrial applications, the backbone network connects multiple industrial field networks together and has to carry massive real-time packets. However, the off-the-shelf time-sensitive network (TSN) switches can deterministically schedule no more than 1024 real-time flows due to the limited number of schedule table entries. The excess real-time flows have to be delivered by best-effort services because the switch only supports the two scheduling services. The best-effort services can reduce average delay, but cannot guarantee the hard real-time constraints of industrial applications. To make the limited number of schedule table entries support more real-time flows, first, we relax scheduling rules to reduce the requirement for schedule table entries and formulate the process of transmitting packets as a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) specification. Then, we divide the SMT specification into multiple optimization modulo theories (OMT) specifications so that the execution time of solvers can be reduced to an acceptable range. Second, we propose fast heuristic algorithms that combine schedule tables and packet injection control to eliminate scheduling conflicts. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations. The evaluation results indicate that, compared to existing algorithms, our proposed algorithm requires only one-twentieth the number of schedule entries to schedule the same flow set.

AB  - Time-sensitive networks (TSNs) support not only traditional best-effort communications but also deterministic communications, which send each packet at a deterministic time so that the data transmissions of networked control systems can be precisely scheduled to guarantee hard real-time constraints. No-wait scheduling is suitable for such TSNs and generates the schedules of deterministic communications with the minimal network resources so that all of the remaining resources can be used to improve the throughput of best-effort communications. However, due to inappropriate message fragmentation, the realtime performance of no-wait scheduling algorithms is reduced. Therefore, in this paper, joint algorithms of message fragmentation and no-wait scheduling are proposed. First, a specification for the joint problem based on optimization modulo theories is proposed so that off-the-shelf solvers can be used to find optimal solutions. Second, to improve the scalability of our algorithm, the worst-case delay of messages is analyzed, and then, based on the analysis, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to construct low-delay schedules. Finally, we conduct extensive test cases to evaluate our proposed algorithms. The evaluation results indicate that, compared to existing algorithms, the proposed joint algorithm improves schedulability by up to 50%.

AB  - The demands for deterministic network services are getting significant. IEEE Time sensitive networking (TSN) task group has aimed for deterministic services through IEEE 802 networks. TSN's solutions rely on the time-synchronization and the slot scheduling coordinated throughout a network. The former requires costly hardware implementations for accuracy and scalability. The latter requires a schedulability analysis, which is proven to be NP-complete and not scalable. For modest-to-large scale dynamic networks, a more flexible solution is necessary. We propose a scalable framework that guarantees any desired jitter upper bound, including zero jitter. The framework is composed of; packets with relative time-stamps, a network that guarantees latency bounds, and buffers at the network egress. The latency bounds of a network can be of any value. The buffer holds packets for predetermined intervals to reproduce arbitrary inter-arrival intervals to inter-departure intervals, based on the network's latency bound. The idea behind the proposed framework is to minimize the latency first with work-conserving schedulers, and then adjust the jitter at the egress of a network. We argue that this is simpler than minimizing latency and jitter at the same time. A direct benefit of such simplicity is its scalability. We examine the network solutions that guarantee latency bound, such as the DiffServ and the Flow aggregate-interleave regulator (FAIR), as the candidates for the component in the framework. We show with a case study and simulations that the proposed framework can guarantee smaller latency bounds, with zero jitter, than those of the TSN's synchronous approach.

AB  - IEEE802.1Qbv (Time-aware Shaper: TAS) has recently been applied within user networks (NWs) for realizing factory automation and remote control. As mass customization matures, TAS is expected to extend its application coverage to not only user NWs but also wide-area NWs to enable real-time communication for remote control and cloud-based application use. However, designing a TAS schedule is an NP-hard problem, which becomes more difficult as the gate control list (GCL) hypercycle increases. In this paper, we propose a method to convert the transmission cycle of Talker to a different cycle time for TAS scheduling in a carrier NW. This results in a smaller GCL hypercycle in the carrier NW. Our evaluation experiments show that the GCL computation time of the proposed method is shorter. This paper contributes to the realization of TAS in the wide-area NW, which has not been discussed so far.

AB  - While customers rivet their eyes on Wi-Fi 6, in the bowels of the IEEE 802.11 Working Group that creates Wi-Fi standards, the next generation Wi-Fi is being developed. At the very first sight, the new IEEE 802.11be amendment to the Wi-Fi standard is nothing but scaled 11ax with doubled bandwidth and the increased number of spatial streams, which together provide data rates as high as 40 Gbps. A bit deeper dive into the 802.11 activities reveals that 11be will support real-time applications. In reality, 11be introduces many more revolutionary changes to Wi-Fi, which will form a basement for further Wi-Fi evolution. Although by now (May 2020), the development process is at the very early phase without any draft specification, the analysis of the discussion in the 802.11 Working Group gives insights into the main innovations of 11be. In addition to the ones above, they include native multi-link operation, channel sounding optimization that opens the door for massive MIMO, advanced PHY and MAC techniques, the cooperation of various access points. The paper analyzes hundreds of features proposed for the new technology, focusing on the open problems that can be solved by the researchers who want to contribute to the development of 802.11be.

AB  - Ethernet has been a backbone of data centers since inception of cloud computing. The reason is its simplicity, cost effectiveness, wide existing base, and maturity. However, Ethernet is unreliable when it comes to providing guaranteed transmission. Consequently, IEEE 802.1Qbb standard has been introduced to provide reliability based on congestion notification (CN) mechanism of IEEE 802.3x. However, IEEE 802.1Qbb has some issues and limitations, such as higher buffer space reservation, lack of support for heterogeneous switching devices, and low throughput and efficiency of the network.

AB  - To guarantee stringent real-time requirements of time-critical traffic in industrial systems, the IEEE time-sensitive networking (TSN) task group has standardized time-aware shaping (TAS) in IEEE 802.1Qbv, which schedules precise and periodic transmission times using preassigned traffic information. However, nonperiodic/unexpected but time-critical traffic, such as emergency events or alarms, may occur in real industrial scenarios, and TAS does not provision for performance of traffic that are unknown a priori, nor the impact thereof on prescheduled traffic. Moreover, recalculating the schedule for every sporadic, nonisochronous event traffic is extremely difficult, complex, and costly. To address these challenges, we propose a novel enhancement to TAS, referred to as eTAS, which defines a new scheduling rule for immediate forwarding of emergency traffic to guarantee real-time performance, while dynamically extending the scheduled time windows to protect scheduled time-critical traffic from the interference of emergency traffic. We evaluate eTAS through extensive simulations on OMNeT++ under an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) scenario for autonomous driving to show that eTAS effectively allows rapid transmission of event traffic with minimal impact on scheduled traffic, even for highly congested networks.

AB  - Reliability is one of the major concerns of Time Sensitive Networking (TSN). Current systems mostly rely on static redundancy to protect functionality from permanent component failures. This greatly increases the cost of Time-Triggered (TT) flows. Instead, Software Defined Networking (SDN) enables dynamic redundancy. Disrupted traffic can be rerouted by a centralized controller to reduce the cost while maintaining reliability. This paper presents an approach to compute alternative paths at run-time and analyze their impact on reliability. We define a novel three-mode recovery scheme, which includes full functionality, reduced functionality, and emergency halt modes. Run-time recovery for TT flows is explored using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and a heuristic algorithm. Then, a Markov chain-based design-time reliability analysis is developed to evaluate the Mean Time to Reduced Functionality Mode (MTTRF) and Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) of run-time recoverable systems. Our experiments show that run-time recovery provides better protection against multi-point failures than static redundancy. Compared with the state of the art, our proposed ILP has better routing efficiency. The proposed heuristic algorithm can perform routing and scheduling in polynomial time, but it tends to route multicast flows to longer paths than ILP. Furthermore, when applied to realistic recovery scenarios, our proposed ILP improves the MTTF by up to 2× and the average execution time by up to 20× than the raw ILP of the state of the art. Although less efficient with multicast flows, the heuristic algorithm achieves similar reliability as the ILP, and its worst-case recovery time is below 100ms on an embedded ARM processor.

AB  - Modern in-vehicle networks are comprised of heterogeneous systems that use various communication protocols with different source clocks. Moreover, gateway systems are designed with additional features that ensure converted/forwarded data meet real-time constraints. In this paper, we propose a synchronization mechanism for FlexRay and Ethernet audio video bridging (AVB) network that guarantees a high quality-of-service. We also designed the corresponding embedded system based-gateway system. Moreover, we built an in-vehicle network environment that consists of FlexRay and Ethernet AVB networks using an embedded system, which is integrated and synchronized by the gateway. We evaluate the synchronization performance of the proposed method using the developed gateway by conducting experiments as well as a theoretical analysis. The results of the experiment show that the synchronization mechanism provides timing guarantees for the FlexRay network that are similar to those of the Ethernet AVB network.

AB  - Traditional in-vehicle networks are statically deployed and configured during the car manufacturing process. However, the growing need for supporting new in-car traffic flows, e.g., to add new camera-based Advanced Driver Assistant Systems (ADAS) or infotainment applications, generates an increasing demand for bandwidth and requires the ability for re-configuring the bandwidth allocation among flows during the vehicle lifecycle. For this reason, this work proposes a partitioning system for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) that allows introducing new flows in the in-vehicle network without affecting the already existing ones. Moreover, the letter presents a simulative assessment of the proposed approach in a realistic automotive scenario.

AB  - The time-sensitive networking (TSN) working group standardizes time-aware shapes (TAS) to reduce network latency, but the traditional TAS standard lacks adaptability and cannot perform well in dynamically changing environments. The continuously developing artificial intelligence techniques can be combined with TSN to better adapt the dynamically changing environments. Therefore, we utilize deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to dynamically configure the network to improve its adaptability. Meanwhile, we propose the queuing transmission method in TAS by incorporating transmission windows for different types of traffic, to make resource allocation simpler and more efficient. However, DRL algorithms usually take a lot of time to train, which is contrary to the delay sensitivity of TAS. Hence, we propose an improved DRL algorithm, called preDQN, where the network prediction is used to help the agent explore the environment more efficiently. Experimental validation is carried out in a simulation environment, and the experimental results show that the scheme can significantly improve the resource utilization, reduce the end-to-end delay and packet loss rate.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) evolves from Ethernet AVB in which the Credit-Based Shaping (CBS) is employed to guarantee the deterministic transmission of traffic. In CBS, the real-time performance of traffic associated with the credits can practicably settle the uncertainty of queueing and forwarding for stream-reservation traffic. Hence, the optimization of bandwidth allocation under the CBS becomes a key point to ensure guaranteed performance in the network. In this paper, a bandwidth allocation method is proposed for stream-reservation traffic while the real-time requirements are satisfied. We first illustrate the significance of appropriate bandwidth allocation for traffic under the CBS and construct a general schema for its bandwidth allocation. Also, the influences of the protected window for Control Data Traffic (CDT) on stream-reservation traffic are considered in our method. Further, mathematical models are constructed to analyze the delay bounds and backlogs of traffic to form the feedback for the optimal bandwidth allocation process. Finally, two node-level cases with different bandwidth utilization and a synthetic industrial networking scenario are carried out to demonstrate our method. The results confirm that the excessive reserved bandwidth does not necessarily decrease the delay bound, especially under the high traffic loads scenario. A more desirable bandwidth allocation strategy under the CBS mechanism is that the reserved bandwidth should be just enough according to the traffic loads to ensure the deterministic transmission of traffic.

AB  - The asynchronous time-sensitive networking (TSN) based on IEEE 802.1Qcr is expected to be a promising solution for the asynchronous transmissions of safety-critical flows without the support of clock synchronization. When the asynchronous traffic shaping (ATS) mechanism is adopted to meet the deadline requirements for transmissions of safety-critical flow, it is necessary to formally verify the real-time properties and corresponding network performance. However, it is still unclear how to build an efficient formal model to evaluate different frame selection methods during the ATS scheduling process, which originate from the dominations of priority or eligibility time. In this paper, we present a formal modeling framework to compare the impacts of different frame selection on transmission sequence under the ATS mechanism. According to the priority level (pATS) or eligibility time (eATS) for flows, two transmission selection methods in ATS are modeled and compared. Then, we verify the real-time properties of ATS. The result shows that the shaping-for-free property can be satisfied with the pATS method but can not be fulfilled with the eATS method. Besides, the timing analysis results illustrate that the eATS method can provide more fairness than the pATS method for the transmission of low-priority flows in TSN networks.

AB  - Audio Video Bridging (AVB) switched Ethernet is being considered as a promising network alternative solution for the automotive industry thanks to its high data transmission rate and dedicated bandwidth for real-time traffic. However, guaranteeing deterministic communications of an AVB switched Ethernet network remains a key issue for safety-critical applications in automotive domain. In order to ensure real-time timeliness constraints for any flow sent in AVB switched Ethernet networks, we establish new bounds on the worst-case end-to-end delay of any flow. Our contributions are the following: (i) We first develop a worst-case delay analysis in the context of AVB switched Ethernet network based on an extension of the Trajectory Approach. (ii) Then we take into account serialization constraints on frame transmissions to improve the computation of worst-case end-to-end delay bounds. (iii) Finally, we refine the proposed approach by taking into consideration the AVB traffic shaping characteristics. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated on a set of representative automotive examples.

AB  - Cyber-physical power system (CPPS) stability is severely affected by the communication network performance due to cyber-physical interdependence. Thus, uncertain cyber-physical coordinated attacks (CPCA) pose more significant threats to CPPS than physical attacks. However, the defense strategies in recent works assume real-time and reliable transmission under an ideal cyber-attack, leading to inaccurate cyber-physical interdependence modeling. Therefore, the strategies are ineffective against uncertain CPCA. This paper proposes a hierarchical CPPS network architecture that integrates time-sensitive networking (TSN) to improve resilience against uncertain CPCA. To model the uncertain CPCA, a coordinated N-K ambiguity set is proposed considering all possible link failures on both cyber and physical layers. For the cyber layer, we propose a joint routing-scheduling model of TSN-based network to support deterministic and reliable data transmission, which improves the accuracy of cyber-physical interdependence. A distributionally robust coordinated defense (DRCD) strategy integrated with cyber-physical interdependence is then proposed to mitigate the priority-based load shedding considering the uncertainties of CPCA. The formulated DRCD strategy is linearized and transformed into a tri-level optimization problem which is efficiently solved by C-CG algorithm. Case studies indicate that the DRCD strategy has superiorities in improving the resilience of CPPS compared with other conventional models.

AB  - Recently, time-sensitive networking (TSN) has been developed to incorporate real-time capabilities to the standard Ethernet for the incompatible issue in existing industrial communication solutions and is considered a promising solution to satisfy the requirements of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, the routing and scheduling methods are left out of the TSN standard. This study developed a novel joint traffic routing and scheduling algorithm to compute routes for time-critical flows and construct the schedules. The validity of the proposed algorithm was verified using a random synthetic test scenario. The simulation results demonstrated that the real-time requirements of time-critical traffic could be satisfied with the proposed algorithm. Subsequently, we evaluated the scalability of the proposed algorithm from the perspective of the number of flows that can be scheduled and the network size. The results showed that the computational times for 4000 flows in the realistic industrial network topology and random network topologies (with up to 21 switches and 105 end stations) are at the subsecond level, which indicated the perfect scalability of the proposed algorithm. In addition, compared with the well-known integer linear programming (ILP)-based approach, Degree of Conflict (DoC)-aware iterative routing and scheduling (DA/IRS) approach, and hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA)-based approach, the proposed algorithm is faster than the three approaches by at least an order of magnitude.

AB  - In modern manufacturing systems, various industrial communication systems (e.g., fieldbus systems and industrial Ethernet networks) have been used to realize reliable information exchange. However, these industrial communication solutions are largely incompatible with each other, which do not satisfy the new requirements of Industry 4.0. Recently Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has been developed to improve the real-time capabilities to the standard Ethernet, and is considered to be a promising real-time communication solution for Industry 4.0. In this work, we propose a communication architecture for a manufacturing system using the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and TSN technologies. TSN is adopted as the communication backbone to connect heterogeneous industrial automation subsystems. The OPC UA is adopted to realize horizontal and vertical communication between subsystems in the field layer and the entities of the upper layers. We implement a laboratory-level manufacturing system to validate the proposed architecture. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and capability of the proposed architecture. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of a key TSN substandard, i.e., IEEE 802.1Qbv, in the laboratory-level manufacturing system. The evaluation results demonstrate that IEEE 802.1Qbv can indeed provide excellent real-time capabilities for industrial applications.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an important research area to update infrastructure of industrial internet of things. Deterministic transmission in TSN is the key technology, mainly including time-triggered scheduling in control plane, mixed-criticality transmission, and deterministic delay analysis, to support deterministic real-time transmission requirements for industrial control. This study surveys the related works on deterministic transmission technologies of TSN in recent years and systematically cards and summarizes them. First, this study presents the different transmission models of different kinds of flows in TSN. Second, based on these models, on the one hand, this study presents time-triggered scheduling model and its research status and existing challenges on control plane. On the other hand, this paper presents the architecture of TSN switches, the strategies of mixed-criticality transmission and their disadvantages and the corresponding improvement approaches. Third, this study models the transmission delay of the whole TSN based on netowork calculus and presents the delay analysis methods, their research status and possible improvement directions. Finally, this study summarizes the challenges and research prospects of deterministic transmission technologies in TSN.

AB  - Time sensitive networks (TSNs) enable deterministic real-time communication over Ethernet networks. According to IEEE 802.1Qbv standards, TSN switches use gates between queues and their corresponding egress ports to facilitate timing-deterministic communications. Management of switch resources, such as queues, has a significant impact on the schedulability of real-time flows. In this paper, we look into the theoretical foundation of queue management in TSN switches. We prove that the queue assignment problem for realtime flows on time sensitive networks under static priority scheduling is NP-hard in the strong sense, even if the number of queues per port is 3. Then we formulate the problem as a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) specification. Besides, we propose a worst case response time analysis and a fast heuristic algorithms by eliminating scheduling conflicts. Experiments with randomly generated workload demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms for queue assignment of real-time flows.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) encompasses standards to facilitate near-deterministic performance in wired networks and the integration of TSN with modern wireless systems, such as Fifth Generation (5G) systems, is intensely pursued. Consequently, TSN is examined by numerous research groups. Given the limited and costly access to TSN hardware, a reliable simulator becomes crucial. OMNeT++ is a modular simulator that can be expanded with network simulation models, such as INET, which can simulate TSN functionalities. We evaluate the accuracy of the OMNeT++ INET simulator in mirroring the physical (hardware-based) reality by comparing OMNeT++ INET simulations with measurements of two commercial TSN switches. Our evaluations encompass the generalized Precision Time Protocol (gPTP) accuracy, the Store-and-Forward (SF) and Cut-Through (CT) switching forwarding latencies, the Time Aware Shaper (TAS), and Frame Preemption (FP), including combinations of CT, TAS, and FP. We find that compared to hardware measurements, INET simulations exhibit different clock synchronization dynamics, underestimate the switching latencies, and do not support CT with FP.We enhance the alignment of INET simulations with authentic hardware behaviors by modifying INET modules. We modify the INET gPTP synchronization model and the INET simulation models for the SF and CT forwarding latencies. Also, we modify the INET simulation modules to support the combined operation of CT and FP. We demonstrate how our INET modifications, which we make publicly available, accurately simulate the behaviors of real TSN hardware.

AB  - The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) set of standards introduces in IEEE 802.1 switches and end stations novel features to meet the requirements of a broad spectrum of applications that are characterized by time-sensitive and mission-critical traffic flows. In particular, the IEEE802.1Qbv-2015 amendment introduces enhancements that provide temporal isolation for scheduled traffic, i.e., a traffic class that requires transmission based on a known timescale, while the IEEE802.1Qbu-2016 introduces preemption as a mechanism to allow time-critical messages to interrupt ongoing non time-critical transmissions. Both amendments, that are now enrolled in the IEEE802.1Q-2018 standard, are very important for industrial networks, where scheduled traffic and low-latency real-time flows have to coexist, on the same network, with best-effort transmissions.In this context, this work presents a response time analysis of TSN networks that encompasses the enhancements for scheduled traffic and preemption, in various combinations. The paper presents the proposed analysis and a performance comparison between the response times calculated by the analysis and the response times obtained through OMNeT++ simulations in three different scenarios.

AB  - Edge enabled Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform is of great significance to accelerate the development of smart industry. However, with the dramatic increase in real-time IIoT applications, it is a great challenge to support fast response time, low latency, and efficient bandwidth utilization. To address this issue, time sensitive network (TSN) is recently researched to realize low latency communication via deterministic scheduling. To the best of our knowledge, the combinability of multiple flows, which can significantly affect the scheduling performance, has never been systematically analyzed before. In this article, we first analyze the combinability problem. Then, a noncollision theory based deterministic scheduling (NDS) method is proposed to achieve ultralow latency communication for the time-sensitive flows. Moreover, to improve bandwidth utilization, a dynamic queue scheduling (DQS) method is presented for the best-effort flows. Experiment results demonstrate that NDS/DQS can well support deterministic ultralow latency services and guarantee efficient bandwidth utilization.

AB  - Time sensitive networking (TSN) is an emerging technology for in-vehicle networks, which has strict timing constraints and dependability requirements. The performance and efficiency of TSN depend on a reliable scheduling mechanism for real-time communications. Traditionally, the TSN scheduler is analyzed using simulations and testing, which are error-prone and inaccurate. In this article, we employ a timed model checker UPPAAL to formally model and analyze the TSN scheduler with a consideration of its transmission latency and time utilization. We first use the build-in assertion in UPPAAL to verify the deadlock-free property, safety property, and starvation-free property of our model. Then, we calculate the time utilization and the transmission delay of audio video bridging data frame under two scheduling mechanisms according to the simulation process. Then, we compared the time performance of this two scheduling mechanisms and found that each of them has their own advantages and disadvantages. This article provides a formal analysis framework for investigating scheduling strategies in TSN, which facilitates the designers to have a better understanding and development of TSN schedulers in the future.

AB  - With real-time communication being a key part of the fourth industrial revolution, the need for Quality of Service (QoS) in industrial networks is gaining increasing importance. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) faces this need, for example, by introducing new scheduling mechanisms. The Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) has been introduced to TSN to offer low delays for multiple traffic classes by applying rate limitations. Currently, flows are reserved decentrally in CBS networks using a Stream Reservation Protocol (SRP). In contrast, the new TSN standard IEEE 802.1Qcc allows for a centralized architecture to favor short reconfiguration latencies. However, no online admission control scheme which offers safe delay bounds has been proposed for this central architecture. To close this gap, we propose two models for admission control in TSN networks using CBS. Both models offer deadline-guaranteeing flow allocation, including routing and prioritization of flows, and configure forwarding devices while eliminating packet loss. Our models utilize the mathematical framework of Network Calculus to calculate worst-case flow delays and buffer sizes. We show how our models allow for more reservations than the decentralized standard approach by improved resource utilization. We validate our models both in synthetic and industrial network scenarios. Additionally, we compare the effects and parameters of our two models, providing guidance on when to choose them.

AB  - Time-sensitive networks (IEEE TSN or IETF DetNet) may tolerate some packet reordering. Re-sequencing buffers are then used to provide in-order delivery, the parameters of which (timeout, buffer size) may affect worst-case delay and delay jitter. There is so far no precise understanding of per-flow reordering metrics nor of the dimensioning of re-sequencing buffers in order to provide worst-case guarantees, as required in such networks. First, we show that a previously proposed per-flow metric, reordering late time offset (RTO), determines the timeout value. If the network is lossless, another previously defined metric, the reordering byte offset (RBO), determines the required buffer. If packet losses cannot be ignored, the required buffer may be larger than RBO, and depends on jitter, an arrival curve of the flow at its source, and the timeout. Then we develop a calculus to compute the RTO for a flow path; the method uses a novel relation with jitter and arrival curve, together with a decomposition of the path into non order-preserving and order-preserving elements. We also analyse the effect of re-sequencing buffers on worst-case delay, jitter and propagation of arrival curves. We show in particular that, in a lossless (but non order-preserving) network, re-sequencing is “for free”, namely, it does not increase worst-case delay nor jitter, whereas in a lossy network, re-sequencing increases the worst-case delay and jitter. We apply the analysis to evaluate the performance impact of placing re-sequencing buffers at intermediate points and illustrate the results on two industrial test cases.

AB  - Dampers are devices that reduce delay jitter in the context of time-sensitive networks, by delaying packets for the amount written in packet headers. Jitter reduction is required by some real-time applications; beyond this, dampers have the potential to solve the burstiness cascade problem of deterministic networks in a scalable way, as they can be stateless. Dampers exist in several variants: some apply only to earliest-deadline-first schedulers, whereas others can be associated with any packet schedulers; some enforce FIFO ordering whereas some others do not. Existing analyses of dampers are specific to some implementations and some network configurations; also, they assume ideal, non-realistic clocks. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of all existing dampers in general network settings and analyze their timing properties in presence of non-ideal clocks. In particular, we give formulas for computing residual jitter bounds of networks with dampers of any kind. We show that non-FIFO dampers may cause reordering due to clock non-idealities and that the combination of FIFO dampers with non-FIFO network elements may very negatively affect the performance bounds. Our results can be used to analyze timing properties and burstiness increase in any time-sensitive network, as we illustrate on an industrial case-study.

AB  - In time-sensitive networks, bounds on worst-case delays are typically obtained by using network calculus and assuming that flows are constrained by bit-level arrival curves. However, in IEEE TSN or IETF DetNet, source flows are constrained on the number of packets rather than bits. A common approach to obtain a delay bound is to derive a bit-level arrival curve from a packet-level arrival curve. However, such a method is not tight: we show that better bounds can be obtained by directly exploiting the arrival curves expressed at the packet level. Our analysis method also obtains better bounds when flows are constrained with g-regulation, such as the recently proposed Length-Rate Quotient rule. It can also be used to generalize some recently proposed network-calculus delay-bounds for a service curve element with known transmission rate.

AB  - Many applications such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), tactile Internet, and 5G/6G mobile require Ultra-Low Latency (ULL) in data transmission. The end-to-end latency is required to be on the order of sub-millisecond in these applications. The IEEE 802.1 Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards have been developed to provide ULL networking. The IEEE 802.1Qbv Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), which is a typical flow control mechanism of TSN, is a traffic shaper to provide deterministic end-to-end ULL transmission for express traffic. The Gate Control List (GCL) of all TAS enabled nodes must be configured in a coordinated manner to ensure ULL. However, existing configuration schemes cannot be employed in highly dynamic conditions where the distribution of time-sensitive streams frequently changes. It will be a significant problem to deal with such dynamic conditions in the future. Therefore, this paper proposes a real-time adaptive gate scheduling scheme for TAS. The scheduling problem is formulated as a boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), and the employment of an FPGA-based solver is proposed to achieve runtime fast computation. The proposed scheme enables real-time reconfiguration for high flexibility and high bandwidth utilization to deal with the dynamics of network conditions. The feasibility of the proposed scheme is confirmed with computer simulations.

AB  - Recently, there has been an interest from the automotive industry in a novel single-pair, half-duplex Ethernet multidrop provision (i.e., 10BASE-T1S), which relies on a coordinated channel access method provided by Physical Layer Collision Avoidance (PLCA). PLCA avoids frame collisions and provides bounded latency, while guaranteeing fairness among nodes and optimal bandwidth utilization. However, despite these advantageous features, PLCA is not aware of flow priorities and, consequently, does not provide priority-based Quality of Service (QoS). Thus, there is an opportunity for integrating QoS-aware schemes, such as the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)-based Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) algorithm, into PLCA. In this paper, we present modeling and analysis strategies using Network Calculus for integrating TAS with PLCA to support scheduled traffic, and we compare our modeling and analysis with a baseline work which previously modeled TAS for full-duplex point-to-point Ethernet only. We show that replacing full-duplex point-to-point links with half-duplex PLCA multidrop links still complies with end-to-end delay deadlines, while leading to a reduction of system costs due to the fewer number of Ethernet transceivers in a PLCA multidrop. Moreover, we also show that our results for TAS, when applied only on full-duplex point-to-point links, outperform the results of the baseline work in most use cases.

AB  - The IEEE 802.1 time sensitive networking working group has recently standardized the time aware shaper (TAS). The TAS provides deterministic latency guarantees but requires tight time synchronization in all network switches. This paper thoroughly evaluates the mean and maximum packet delays and packet losses of the TAS for a typical industrial control ring network for random (sporadic) and for periodic traffic. We propose and evaluate adaptive bandwidth sharing and adaptive slotted window mechanisms to make TAS adaptive to traffic fluctuations. This paper further evaluates the asynchronous traffic shaper (ATS), which has been proposed to provide low latency network service without the need for time synchronization in network nodes. Our evaluations indicate that TAS with proper configurations, e.g., accurate and precise gating schedules, generally achieves the specified latency bounds for both sporadic and periodic traffic. In contrast, ATS performs relatively well for sporadic traffic; but struggles for moderate to high loads of periodic traffic.

AB  - Many network applications, e.g., industrial control, demand ultra-low latency (ULL). However, traditional packet networks can only reduce the end-to-end latencies to the order of tens of milliseconds. The IEEE 802.1 time sensitive networking (TSN) standard and related research studies have sought to provide link layer support for ULL networking, while the emerging IETF deterministic networking (DetNet) standards seek to provide the complementary network layer ULL support. This paper provides an up-to-date comprehensive survey of the IEEE TSN and IETF DetNet standards and the related research studies. The survey of these standards and research studies is organized according to the main categories of flow concept, flow synchronization, flow management, flow control, and flow integrity. ULL networking mechanisms play a critical role in the emerging fifth generation (5G) network access chain from wireless devices via access, backhaul, and core networks. We survey the studies that specifically target the support of ULL in 5G networks, with the main categories of fronthaul, backhaul, and network management. Throughout, we identify the pitfalls and limitations of the existing standards and research studies. This survey can thus serve as a basis for the development of standards enhancements and future ULL research studies that address the identified pitfalls and limitations.

AB  - The rise of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has sparked a significant transformation in the domain of industrial networks. Concurrently, industrial networks have established new benchmarks for communication quality, characterized by stringent requirements for low latency, minimal jitter, and enhanced reliability. In this context, the TSN subcommittee under the IEEE 802.1 working group has released a comprehensive collection of protocol standards. These standards are intricately crafted to ensure deterministic low latency in inherently unpredictable Ethernet environments. To enhance deterministic Quality of Service (QoS) in industrial networks and increase the flexibility of network scheduling paradigms, emerging technologies that combine TSN with Software-Defined Networking (TSSDN) have gained significant attention. Nevertheless, due to the complex and multifaceted nature of factory workflows and the varying scheduling requirements at different hierarchical levels, current industrial scheduling methods encounter challenges in efficiently managing network traffic in real-world factory environments. In this paper, we present a systematic framework designed for the scheduling of factory traffic. Additionally, we introduce two distinct scheduling mechanisms, each based on a framework with relaxed constraints. These mechanisms correspond to intra-level and inter-level traffic transmission in industrial networks. According to our experimental results, we observe an increase of 12.6% to 25.32% in the relaxed constraint scheduling mechanism when compared to the single scheduling scheme, along with a 9% reduction in the proportion of occupied queues.

AB  - To achieve low latency transmission of time-sensitive flows in Ethernet networks, the IEEE introduced the IEEE 802.1Qbu Standard, which specifies a 1-level preemption scheme for IEEE 802.1 networks. The specification allows the suspension of a preemptable frame prior to its completion for the speedy transmission of an express frame; but any other preemptable frame cannot be transmitted before the completion of the already preempted frame. While this approach improves the performance of express frames, the performance is negatively impacted in scenarios where the number of express frames is high. Another limitation is the fact that preemptable frames with timing requirements can suffer long blocking periods due to the non-preemptive service of frames in the same category. This is irrespective of the individual priority level of each frame. Recently, a multi-level preemption scheme has been proposed to circumvent these limitations. The work focused on the feasibility and implementation requirement of such an approach, but a formal analysis of the worst-case performance guarantees under the proposed scheme was not provided. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting the aforementioned analysis of the TSN IEEE 802.1Qbu networks under the multi-level preemption assumption. Evaluation is performed with a realistic automotive use-case and the results showcase an improvement up to 53.07% for preemptable frames with firm timing requirements.To achieve low latency transmission of time-sensitive flows in Ethernet networks, the IEEE introduced the IEEE 802.1Qbu Standard, which specifies a 1-level preemption scheme for IEEE 802.1 networks.

AB  - Higher levels of automated driving also require a more sophisticated environmental perception. Therefore, an increasing number of sensors transmit their data samples as frame bursts to other applications for further processing. As a vehicle has to react to its environment in time, such data is subject to safety-critical latency constraints. To keep up with the resulting data rates, there is an ongoing transition to a Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)-based communication backbone. However, the use of TSN-related industry standards does not match the automotive requirements of large timely sensor data transmission, nor it offers benefits on timecritical transmissions of single control data packets. By using the full data rate of prioritized IEEE 802.1Q Ethernet, giving time guarantees on large data samples is possible, but with strongly degraded results due to data collision. Resolving such collisions with time-aware shaping comes with significant overhead. Hence, rather than optimizing the parameters of the existing protocol, we propose a system design that synchronizes the transmission times of sensor data samples. This limits network protocol complexity and hardware requirements by avoiding tight time synchronization and time-aware shaping. We demonstrate that individual sensor data samples are transmitted without significant interference, exclusively at full Ethernet data rate. We provide a synchronous event model together with a straightforward response time analysis for synchronous multi-frame sample transmissions. The results show that worst-case latencies of such sample communication, in contrast to non-synchronized approaches, are close to their theoretical minimum as well as to simulative results while keeping the overall network utilization high.

AB  - With Industry Internet being more advanced and sophisticated, different closed network domains tend to collaborate on the same task and provide strict Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. However, current Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Deterministic Networking (DetNet) technologies make it hard to meet the needs of multi-domain collaboration with bounded low service latency. To deal with this dilemma, a time-sensitive flow scheduling scheme across multiple network domains is necessary. In this paper, we propose a deterministic cross-domain flow scheduling (DCDFS) solution to overcome the barriers of inter-domain microbursts not considered by TSN and DetNet. First, a novel hierarchical architecture is designed to support cross-domain coordination, deterministic cycle mapping, and flexible queue stitching functions for DCDFS. Second, we build the system model and formulate the cross-domain flow scheduling problem under a general linear programming (LP) model with core constraints. Third, an effective heuristic algorithm named DCDFS-greedy strategy (DCDFS-GS) is proposed to solve this scheduling problem and reduce the search complexity in multi-domain networks. Finally, simulations in realistic network environments show that DCDFS outperforms the state-of-the-art deterministic schemes for cross-domain scheduling, and optimization algorithms can further improve schedulability and resource utilization.

AB  - With the continued evolution of autonomous driving, the communication demand for in-vehicle networks (IVNs) has dramatically increased, and the traditional IVN solutions have become ineligible for the needs of new in-vehicle applications. Time-sensitive network (TSN) with the characteristics of determinism, low latency, high reliability, large bandwidth, and open industry standards, has been considered as the most promising technology for the next-generation IVNs. This article summarizes the current state and methodologies of in-vehicle TSN research through the following five aspects: 1) Quality of Service (QoS) strategy; 2) reliability; 3) clock synchronization; 4) network planning; and 5) network management. The corresponding research priorities and technical challenges are also addressed, respectively.

AB  - Packet-switched fronthaul networks are often designed following the rule that the worst-case network delay must be below a given target end-to-end network latency budget. However, the theoretical maximum delay can be too pessimistic in particular scenarios, where the latency budget needs to be a very small or there is a need to stretch the distance between the radio heads and the baseband units. In this paper, we propose to use a very high packet delay percentiles as an alternative to the maximum theoretical delay in order to stretch the range of the fronthaul links at the expense of a higher frame loss ratio (FLR), within the limits established by eCPRI and the IEEE 802.1 CM. Several methods to estimate the percentiles for the IU/IID eCPRI functional splits are analyzed. Namely, G/G/1 and N*D/D/1 queueing models are tested and compared with simulation as dimensioning tools. The results support that the N*D/D/1 queue is able to model the behavior of a packet-switch fronthaul aggregator using the eCPRI standard for 5g New Radio (NR) Fronthaul streams and can be used as a tool to dimension the length of the links. The experiments show that the fronthaul links' lengths can be increased by 60% and 10% for 50- and 100-MHz NR channels, respectively, while keeping the latency budget and frame loss ratio within the IEEE 802.1 CM limits.

AB  - Existing response time analysis and optimization techniques for real-time distributed systems show that EDF schedulers feature better scheduling capabilities when a global clock reference can be used; this form of scheduling is known as global-clock EDF. In this context, precise clock synchronization is an enabling technology for future distributed real-time systems that want to leverage EDF scheduling. The IEEE 802.1AS protocol can be considered a stable technology for this purpose, as it is part of the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) family of standards to provide real-time communication over Ethernet. This paper presents a system architecture for applying global-clock EDF scheduling in distributed systems with soft real-time requirements. It also presents experiments to (1) assess the synchronization capabilities of the clock synchronization mechanism in the pro-posed architecture, (2) evaluate the performance of different scheduling deadline assignment techniques, and (3) contrast the theoretical results obtained by the schedulability analysis against those obtained through the execution of these experiments.

AB  - In this article, we advocate for the use of IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) as deterministic transport for the network layer of fog computing in industrial automation. We give an overview of the relevant TSN protocol services and motivate the use of TSN. We propose a configuration agent architecture based on IEEE 802.1Qcc and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA), capable of performing runtime network configuration. We briefly present the configuration challenges for scheduled networks (considering a subset of TSN mechanisms), and illustrate one problem: the configuration of schedule tables of such networks for hard real-time control applications. We propose a list scheduling-based heuristic to solve this problem. Our evaluation and comparison to previous work demonstrate the feasibility of reconfiguring the scheduled network at runtime for industrial applications within the fog.

AB  - Fifth Generation (5G) phase 2 rollouts are around the corner to make mobile ultra-reliable and low-latency services a reality. However, to realize that scenario, besides the new 5G built-in Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) capabilities, it is required to provide a substrate network with deterministic Qual-ity-of-Service support for interconnecting the different 5G network functions and services. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) appears as an appealing network technology to meet the 5G connectivity needs in many scenarios involving critical services and their coexistence with Mobile Broadband traffic. In this article, we delve into the adoption of asynchronous TSN for 5G backhauling and some of the relevant related aspects. We start motivating TSN and introducing its mainstays. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview of the architecture and operation of the Asynchronous Traffic Shaper (ATS), the building block of asynchronous TSN. Next, a management framework based on ETSI Zero-touch network and Service Management (ZSM) and Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) reference models is presented for enabling the TSN transport network slicing and its interworking with Fifth Generation (5G) for backhauling. Then we cover the flow allocation problem in asynchronous TSNs and the importance of Machine Learning techniques for assisting it. Last, we present a simulation-based proof-of-concept (PoC) to assess the capacity of ATS-based forwarding planes for accommodating 5G data flows.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Deterministic Networking (DetNet) technologies are increasingly recognized as key levers of the future 5G transport networks (TNs) due to their capabilities for providing deterministic Quality-of-Service and enabling the coexistence of critical and best-effort services. Additionally, they rely on programmable and cost-effective Ethernet-based forwarding planes. This article addresses the flow allocation problem in 5G backhaul networks realized as asynchronous TSN networks, whose building block is the Asynchronous Traffic Shaper. We propose an offline solution, dubbed “Next Generation Transport Network Optimizer” (NEPTUNO), that combines exact optimization methods and heuristic techniques and leverages data analytics to solve the flow allocation problem. NEPTUNO aims to maximize the flow acceptance ratio while guaranteeing the deterministic Quality-of-Service requirements of the critical flows. We carried out a performance evaluation of NEPTUNO regarding the degree of optimality, execution time, and flow rejection ratio. Furthermore, we compare NEPTUNO with a novel online baseline solution for two different optimization goals. Online methods compute the flow's allocation configuration right after the flow arrives at the network, whereas offline solutions like NEPTUNO compute a long-term configuration allocation for the whole network. Our results highlight the potential of data analytics for the self-optimization of the future 5G TNs.

AB  - Dependable, safety-critical real-time (SCRT) systems are becoming increasingly important and complex. Examples of such systems are autonomous or self-driving cars which are poised to revolutionise the transport industry. A critical part of these SCRT systems is the network communication protocol that is used by components in an SCRT system to exchange data. Communication protocols for SCRT systems are required to exhibit predictable, worst-case execution times and thus have to be designed in a more static and less flexible way. To ensure this predictability, current state-of-art communication protocols for SCRT systems are based on the Time-Triggered Architecture (TTA), where static and equal-length time-slots are used for all nodes to access the communication channel, irrespective of the size of their transmission payload. This determinism forms the basis of predictable timing, behaviour and fault tolerance. However, this determinism comes at the cost of poor channel and bandwidth utilisation, which hinders the development of SCRT systems. In this paper, we propose a more flexible approach, INCUS+, that allocates the slot length of a node based on its transmission requirements in a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) round. We achieve this while retaining the level of dependability required for SCRT systems and ensuring fail-silence. We validate this through formal verification of the timing parameters for the transmission windows of all participating nodes as well as independent bus guardians. Our design exhibits a significant improvement in bandwidth and channel utilisation, as we demonstrate in an autonomous vehicle case study.

AB  - This paper proposes a new paradigm for control plane in Time Sensitive Networks (TSN). An SDN controller proactively instructs network elements on the reconfigurations to perform locally if some specific events occur (e.g., failures, performance degradations). Instructions are given in the form of Finite State Machines (FSMs), which store information related to the actions that each network element should execute to react against a specific event. Thus, if such event occurs, the SDN controller is by-passed reducing reaction (e.g., recovery) time. Such an approach is here implemented for recovery upon failures in TSN. Experiments of failure recovery are carried out and measurements are presented comparing the FSM-based solution with a fully-centralized reactive restoration. Moreover, the proposed approach is compared through simulations against Frame Replication and Elimination for Reliability. Results will show how proactive FSM manipulation can strongly reduce recovery time in SDN-based TSN networks without overloading the network with frame replicas.

AB  - This work presents a novel use case with Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN) for implementing a deterministic system allowing the joint transmission of all substation communications over the same Ethernet-based infrastructure. This approach streamlines the transition to Smart Grid by simplifying the typically complex architecture of electrical substations, characterized by multiple field buses and bridging devices. Thus, Smart Grid represents a disruptive innovation advancing substations to an “all-digital” environment with a uniform interface to access, manage, and update their communications and variables. TSN can serve as its underlying foundation as it is based on open, interoperable standards and enhancements for Ethernet that can establish deterministic communications with bounded end-to-end latency. This is shown with a TSN Proof of Concept (PoC) in a real-life substation that can integrate its most usual signals: digitized analog triggers for critical events or interlocks, GOOSE signaling (IEC 61850), and Best-Effort “Internet-like” traffic. This TSN PoC is shown to be versatile enough to propagate digitized critical events around 160 μs earlier than legacy substation equipment while preserving the integrity of background traffic. Furthermore, its flexibility was characterized in-depth in controlled laboratory tests, thereby confirming TSN as a viable alternative for supporting Smart Grid so long as the appropriate configuration is supplied.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a next generation local area network technology for the coexistence of information and operation technology, targeted to industrial automation, in-vehicle networks, and avionic networks in the industrial Internet of Things. This paper presents an up-to-date survey of the research efforts in TSN over the past few years, including the latest efforts in standardization by the IEEE. We review more than 170 TSN-related academic research papers published by major academic publishers and categorize these studies according to the topic, purpose, and methodology, analyzing research trends in TSN. The TSN core function deals with the functional and internal perspective to achieve ultra-low latency/jitter and ultra-reliability. Network management includes work with macroscopic and external views, such as configuration, management, and maintenance of TSN-enabled networks. In particular, we analyze the characteristics of existing studies that have evaluated the TSN network and propose future directions to advance the limits of TSN for real-world deployment. We aim this study to be a cornerstone for fellow and new researchers.

AB  - Deterministic and low latency communications are increasingly becoming essential requirements for several safety-critical applications, such as automotive and automation industries. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an element of the new IEEE 802.1 standards that introduced Ethernet-based amendments to support these applications. One of these enhancements was presented in IEEE 802.1Qbv to define the time-aware shaping (TAS) technique for time-triggered (TT) traffic scheduling. The TAS mechanism is window-based scheduling using a gating system controlled by the gate control list (GCL) schedules in all nodes. Although several scheduling algorithms have been proposed to investigate the effects of window-related parameters on network performance, the offset difference ( $OD$ ) between the same-class windows in the adjoining nodes has not been optimized yet. These optimizations are extremely crucial to implement less pessimistic latency schedules. This paper proposes an optimized flexible window-overlapping scheduling (OFWOS) algorithm that optimizes TT window offsets based on latency evaluations considering the overlapping between different priority windows at the same node. First, we formulate the GCL timings as mathematical forms under variable $OD\text{s}$ between the same-priority windows. Then, an analytical model is implemented using the network calculus (NC) approach to express the worst-case end-to-end delay ( $WCD$ ) for TT flows and evaluated using a realistic vehicular use case. The OFWOS model optimizes $OD$ under all overlapping situations between TT windows at the same node. Compared with the latest works of 3-hop and 30-hop TSN connections, the OFWOS reduces the $WCD$ bounds by 8.4% and 32.6%, respectively, accomplishing less pessimistic end-to-end latency bounds.

AB  - Deterministic latency is an urgent demand to pursue the continuous increase in intelligence in several real-time applications, such as connected vehicles and automation industries. A time-sensitive network (TSN) is a new framework introduced to serve these applications. Several functions are defined in the TSN standard to support time-triggered (TT) requirements, such as IEEE 802.1Qbv and IEEE 802.1Qbu for traffic scheduling and preemption mechanisms, respectively. However, implementing strict timing constraints to support scheduled traffic can miss the needs of unscheduled real-time flows. Accordingly, more relaxed scheduling algorithms are required. In this paper, we introduce the flexible window-overlapping scheduling (FWOS) algorithm that optimizes the overlapping among TT windows by three different metrics: the priority of overlapping, the position of overlapping, and the overlapping ratio (OR). An analytical model for the worst-case end-to-end delay (WCD) is derived using the network calculus (NC) approach considering the relative relationships between window offsets for consecutive nodes and evaluated under a realistic vehicle use case. While guaranteeing latency deadline for TT traffic, the FWOS algorithm defines the maximum allowable OR that maximizes the bandwidth available for unscheduled transmission. Even under a non-overlapping scenario, less pessimistic latency bounds have been obtained using FWOS than the latest related works.

The time-sensitive network (TSN) is introduced as Ethernet-based amendments in IEEE 802.1 TSN standards to support time-triggered (TT) traffic in these applications. In the presence of TT flows, TSN is designed to integrate Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) and Best Effort (BE) traffic types. Although AVB traffic has a lower priority than TT, it still requires low and deterministic latency performance, which may not be guaranteed under strict predefined TT scheduling constraints. For this reason, a window-overlapping scheduling algorithm is recently proposed in different works as analytical forms for TT latency under overlapping-windows based. But worst-case AVB latency evaluation under overlapped TT windows is also essential for critical optimizations and tradeoffs. In this paper, a worst-case end-to-end delay (WCD) for AVB traffic under overlapping-based TT windows (AVB-OBTTW) algorithm is proposed. Separate analytical models are derived using the network calculus (NC) approach for AVB-OBTTW with both non-preemption and preemption mechanisms. Using an actual vehicular use case, the proposed models are evaluated with back-to-back and porosity configurations under light and heavy loading scenarios. For specific AVB credit bounds, a clear WCD reduction has been achieved by increasing the overlapping ratio (OR), especially under back-to-back configuration. Preemption and non-preemption modes are compared under different loading conditions, resulting in lower WCDs using preemption mode than non-preemption, especially with porosity style. Compared to the latest related works, AVB-OBTTW reduces WCD bounds and increases unscheduled bandwidth, leading to the highest enhancements with the maximum allowable OR.

AB  - The aim of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is to provide determinism to IEEE 802 networks. With TSN, data streams of general background applications can share the same standards-based network infrastructure without impacting time-critical applications, also leading to cost savings by using a single network infrastructure. Deterministic ultra-low latency increases efficiency for operations that require consistent message exchange. The most stringent delay requirements are specified for industrial and fronthaul network applications; thus, we demonstrate network engineering aspects in these two networking scenarios. In industrial networking, deterministic delays are important, especially for real-time control processes. In fronthaul networks, the timely delivery of data units with minimum delay variations is required for efficient operation. In this article, we present two mature TSN tools: time gated queuing and frame preemption. Then we highlight their operational and design aspects when using them in industrial and fronthaul networks, investigating their applicability through different simulation scenarios.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has presented extremely harsh requirements on deterministic transmission capability within different communication networks. However, most existing solutions mainly focus on one specific homogeneous scenario, such as pure IP routers or classical medium access control bridges, which leads to many tough challenges in flexibility and scalability. In this article, we propose a framework for heterogeneous deterministic networks (HDNs) to offer low latency and high reliability in tackling epidemics based on smart collaborative theory. Various wired and wireless connecting patterns are supported by utilizing a hybrid mode for COVID-19 relevant operations. Components generated from deterministic networking, time-sensitive networks, and 5G systems have been integrated to achieve corresponding features. The pervasive function translators are available according to virtualization technologies. The protocol-independent and segment-based concepts have been well considered and successfully implemented during our design process. The validations executed on top of the prototype and simulation platform illustrate the advantages of HDN. We aim to enable HDN as an evolutional structure for information exchange in eHealth and other vertical industries.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking is an emerging technology that enables deterministic and reliable transmission in bridged Ethernet networks. The enhancement for scheduled traffic defined in IEEE 802.1Qbv [1] allows to implement time-aware shaping (TAS) which grants periodic slices for transmission to various priority queues of a bridge. TAS is an enabler for traffic scheduling, i.e., frame transmissions of periodic streams at senders and the TAS on intermediate bridges are configured such that these frames experience no loss and hardly any queuing delay. Thereby, deterministic bounds on delay and jitter can be guaranteed to such streams. However, the standard does not provide an algorithm to compute transmission schedules. Therefore, more than 100 research works [Stüber et al. (2023)] propose various algorithms for computing such schedules. Nevertheless, there are still many challenges to solve in this area. In this work, we implement eleven of these algorithms and compare their performance under various conditions with regard to schedule quality and runtime. It reveals that the performance of the algorithms varies a lot and points out their shortcomings. The set of problem instances for this study covers a wide range of parameters and is released to the public so that the performance of new algorithms can be easily compared to those in this study.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is an enhancement of Ethernet which provides various mechanisms for real-time communication. Time-triggered (TT) traffic represents periodic data streams with strict real-time requirements. Amongst others, TSN supports scheduled transmission of TT streams, i.e., the transmission of their frames by end stations is coordinated in such a way that none or very little queuing delay occurs in intermediate nodes. TSN supports multiple priority queues per egress port. The TAS uses so-called gates to explicitly allow and block these queues for transmission on a short periodic timescale. The TAS is utilized to protect scheduled traffic from other traffic to minimize its queuing delay. In this work, we consider scheduling in TSN which comprises the computation of periodic transmission instants at end stations and the periodic opening and closing of queue gates. In this paper, we first give a brief overview of TSN features and standards. We state the TSN scheduling problem and explain common extensions which also include optimization problems. We review scheduling and optimization methods that have been used in this context. Then, the contribution of currently available research work is surveyed. We extract and compile optimization objectives, solved problem instances, and evaluation results. Research domains are identified, and specific contributions are analyzed. Finally, we discuss potential research directions and open problems.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) can offer deterministic low-latency communication, making it a critical solution for high-level autonomous vehicle's in-vehicle network. The deterministic transmission of TSN relies on TSN traffic scheduling. To ensure real-time transmission performance and vehicle functional safety, in-vehicle TSN scheduling aims to reduce end-to-end delay. Despite the promising potential of graph neural networks and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in navigating complex TSN scheduling environments, its application has predominantly been limited to enhancing schedulability without a targeted focus on minimizing delays. This article introduces a DRL in-vehicle TSN scheduling framework based on the graph attention network (GAT). The scheduling problem is abstracted as a delay optimization problem and mapped to a Markov decision process (MDP), which is solved using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. The GAT with attention mechanism is incorporated to extract critical information to enhance feature extraction and improve scheduling accuracy. This GAT-based PPO method can achieve high-precision offline scheduling through training, producing low-delay scheduling results. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method improves offline scheduling performance compared to other DRL-based scheduling methods. Leveraging the trained neural network, the proposed method can also deliver high robustness in online scheduling under link failure scenarios. It can produce a scheduling solution in just 3.8 s, and the scheduling results for all failure scenarios surpass those of rule-based benchmarking methods.

AB  - In-vehicle time-sensitive networking (TSN) delivers highly secure, ultralow latency deterministic communication for intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs). To tackle the traffic scheduling problem of in-vehicle TSN, this study establishes in-vehicle network topologies and flow models, abstracts the traffic scheduling problem as a job-shop scheduling problem (JSSP), and formulates a priority-based optimization function capable of various end-to-end (E2E) delay requirements. A joint routing and scheduling optimization strategy based on improved grey wolf optimization (IGWO) is proposed, which incorporates acrlong LF, historical experience learning, and acrlong TS operators to significantly enhance search capabilities and optimization efficiency. This strategy can rapidly solve large-scale in-vehicle network scheduling and generate scheduling results with outstanding delay performance. Dynamic routing that combines load-balanced and shortest path effectively minimizes interference between flows, further reducing E2E delay. Simulation experiments grounded in realistic ICV scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Furthermore, the simulation results verify the impact of flow period parameters and network topologies on E2E delay, offering guidance for in-vehicle TSN engineering design.

AB  - The in-vehicle network (IVN) architecture significantly impacts the performance of high-level autonomous vehicles. This paper proposed an innovative optimization design framework for in-vehicle time-sensitive networking (TSN) architecture. This pioneering framework is specifically designed to optimize switch port assignment, load distribution, and end-to-end delay. To balance port allocation and load distribution, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated. An adaptive non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), which in-corporates adaptive crossover and mutation probabilities, is employed to identify candidate topologies. The end-to-end delay is evaluated by an improved gray wolf optimizer (IGWO) based TSN scheduling algorithm. By integrating genetic and tabu search operators, the efficiency and scheduling effectiveness of the IGWO are significantly enhanced. The simulation verifies the superiority of the adaptive NSGA-II and IGWO on search capability. A design instance for a high-level autonomous vehicle is completed based on the proposed framework. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the design framework, and some design ideas are summarized.

AB  - In feed-forward time-sensitive networks with Deficit Round-Robin (DRR), worst-case delay bounds were obtained by combining Total Flow Analysis (TFA) with the strict service curve characterization of DRR by Tabatabaee et al. The latter is the best-known single server analysis of DRR, however the former is dominated by Polynomial-size Linear Programming (PLP), which improves the TFA bounds and stability region, but was never applied to DRR networks. We first perform the necessary adaptation of PLP to DRR by computing burstiness bounds per-class and per-output aggregate and by enabling PLP to support non-convex service curves. Second, we extend the methodology to support networks with cyclic dependencies: This raises further dependency loops, as, on one hand, DRR strict service curves rely on traffic characteristics inside the network, which comes as output of the network analysis, and on the other hand, TFA or PLP requires prior knowledge of the DRR service curves. This can be solved by iterative methods, however PLP itself requires making cuts, which imposes other levels of iteration, and it is not clear how to combine them. We propose a generic method, called PLP-DRR, for combining all the iterations sequentially or in parallel. We show that the obtained bounds are always valid even before convergence; furthermore, at convergence, the bounds are the same regardless of how the iterations are combined. This provides the best-known worst-case bounds for time-sensitive networks, with general topology, with DRR. We apply the method to an industrial network, where we find significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art.

AB  - Packet replication and elimination functions are used by time-sensitive networks (as in the context of IEEE TSN and IETF DetNet) to increase the reliability of the network. Packets are replicated onto redundant paths by a replication function. Later the paths merge again and an elimination function removes the duplicates. This redundancy scheme has an effect on the timing behavior of time-sensitive networks and many challenges arise from conducting timing analyses. The replication can induce a burstiness increase along the paths of replicates, as well as packet mis-ordering that could increase the delays in the crossed bridges or routers. The induced packet mis-ordering could also negatively affect the interactions between the redundancy and scheduling mechanisms such as traffic regulators (as with per-flow regulators and interleaved regulators, implemented by TSN asynchronous traffic shaping). Using the network calculus framework, we provide a method of worst-case timing analysis for time-sensitive networks that implement redundancy mechanisms in the general use case, i.e., at end-devices and/or intermediate nodes. We first provide a network calculus toolbox for bounding the burstiness increase and the amount of reordering caused by the elimination function of duplicate packets. We then analyze the interactions with traffic regulators and show that their shaping-for-free property does not hold when placed after a packet elimination function. We provide a bound for the delay penalty when using per-flow regulators and prove that the penalty is not bounded with interleaved regulators. Finally, we use an industrial use-case to show the applicability and the benefits of our findings.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the reliability, validity, and sensitivity of a novel device (Notio Konect (TM)) which is purported to provide a real-time analysis of aerodynamic drag area (CdA) during cycling.Design: Observational, cross-sectional study.Methods: Fifteen trained cyclists rode in an indoor velodrome using three different positions (upright, aero [holding aero bars], and optimized aero [similar to aero, but wearing a time-trial helmet]). They completed six 1-min trials in each position. The CdA was measured with Notio and with two other systems (Track Aero System (TM) [TAS] and a validated mathematical model).Results: The CdA measured with Notio showed good reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.92, 90% confidence interval [CI]=0.89-0.95). Notio showed an almost perfect relationship with both TAS (ICC= 0.99, 90% CI = 0.98-0.99) and the mathematical model (ICC= 0.99, 90% CI = 0.98-0.99). However, the CdA values provided by the former (0.308 +/- 0.051 m(2)) were significantly higher (albeit with a trivial effect size [ES]) compared with TAS (0.300+0.051 m(2), p < 0.001, ES= 0.15) and the mathematical model (0.303 +/- 0.051 m(2), p = 0.005, ES = 0.09). The CdA was higher in the upright than in the aero position with all systems (all p< 0.001, ES= 1.84-1.89), and higher in the aero than in the optimized aero position when measured with TAS (p = 0.033, ES= 0.22) or the mathematical model (p= 0.024, ES= 0.24), but not with Notio (p = 0.220, ES= 0.19).Conclusions: Notio appears to be reliable, strongly correlated to other established systems, and discerns large (upright vs aero) but not small (aero vs optimized aero)variations in riding position. Further research is needed to confirm its validity in outdoor conditions. (C) 2019 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Industrial communication systems represent one of the most important innovations of the last decades in the context of factory and process automation systems. They are networks specifically designed to cope with the tight requirements of these challenging application fields such as real time, determinism, and reliability. Moreover, industrial networks are often deployed in environments characterized by strong electromagnetic interference, mechanical stress, critical temperature, and humidity. Over the last three decades, different classes of industrial networks have been developed according to changing requirements and available communication and information technologies. In this paper, we first provide an account of the state of the art, reviewing classical fieldbuses, real-time Ethernet networks, and industrial wireless networks, along with their most relevant features, applications, and performance figures. We introduce the complex standardization framework and analyze the market status and assumptions for future development. In the second part, we address the future perspectives focusing on new technologies, standards, and fields of application. In particular, we consider the time-sensitive networking (TSN) family of standards, Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) systems, high-performance wireless LANs, industrial applications of cellular networks, and Ethernet networks for automotive communication.

AB  - Thanks to the standards being developed by IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group, the classical IEEE 802.1 Ethernet architecture is now enhanced to accommodate real-time and safety-critical requirements emerging in various cyber-physical systems. The deterministic nature of the communication is achieved through the time-triggered traffic, which requires introducing strict scheduling constraints that may be an obstacle in finding a feasible schedule. In this article, we propose a simple hardware enhancement of a switch along with a relaxed scheduling constraint that increases schedulability and throughput of the time-triggered traffic but maintains the deterministic nature and timeliness guarantees in a TSN network. We give a formal proof to justify the claims and an algorithm benchmarking and experimental validation to demonstrate the gains. The results show that the number of flows that can be scheduled in the model with the relaxed constraint is on average by 75.1 % larger than in the traditional model.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze the secrecy and throughput of multiple-input single-output (MISO) energy harvesting (EH) Internet of Things (IoT) systems, in which a multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits signals to IoT devices (IoTDs) with the help of relays. Specifically, the communication process is separated into two phases. In the first phase, the BS applies transmit antenna selection (TAS) to broadcast the signal to the relays and IoTDs by using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Here, the relays use power-splitting-based relaying (PSR) for EH and information processing. In the second phase, the selected relay employs the amplify-and-forward (AF) technique to forward the received signal to the IoTDs using NOMA. The information transmitted from the BS to the IoTD risks leakage by the relay, which is able to act as an eavesdropper (EAV) (i.e., an untrusted relay). To analyze the secrecy performance, we investigate three schemes: random-BS-best-relay (RBBR), best-BS-random-relay (BBRR), and best-BS-best-relay (BBBR). The physical layer secrecy (PLS) performance is characterized by deriving closed-form expressions of secrecy outage probability (SOP) for the IoTDs. A BS transmit power optimization algorithm is also proposed to achieve the best secrecy performance. Based on this, we then evaluate the system performance of the considered system, i.e., the outage probability and throughput. In addition, the impacts of the EH time, the power-splitting ratio, the numbers of BS antennas, and the numbers of untrusted relays on the SOP and throughput are investigated. The Monte Carlo approach is applied to verify our analytical results. Finally, the numerical examples indicate that the system performance of BBBR is greater than that of RBBR and BBRR.

AB  - Over the last two decades, IEEE has been defining standards for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). These standards combine traffic shaping and scheduling mechanisms to guarantee bounded delays across an Ethernet network. Time-Sensitive Networks are designed for applications where delays are critical, such as process control, networks for vehicles and aircraft, and virtual reality applications. Many industrial companies are currently actively implementing TSN standards. The goal of this paper is to provide a concise and self-contained description of the TSN mechanisms and how they affect the network performance metrics. The paper is intended for practicing engineers wanting to improve their understanding of TSN and for students curious about these mechanisms.

AB  - With the advancement of Industry 4.0, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has become essential for ensuring prompt and reliable data transmission. As an augmentation of Ethernet, TSN aims to supply services capable of low latency, minimal jitter, and low packet loss for urgent data in decentralized, user-oriented networks. Efficient detection techniques are integral to TSN for swiftly determining the practicability of network configurations, as existing schedulability analysis proves insufficient. This paper delves into the potential of backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) in schedulability analysis efficiency. We optimize BPNN using spearman correlation feature selection combined with a voting ensemble method and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), forming two models: Spearman-Vote-BPNN and Spearman-PSO-BPNN. Testing on 5,000 network configurations in computer simulations, both models demonstrated high generalization accuracy, around 97.4%. Spearman-Vote-BPNN achieved the fastest training speed at 0.63 s and an accuracy of 98.2%. Meanwhile, Spearman-PSO-BPNN showed the highest accuracy (98.5%) with the quickest detection speed (5.6 ms). The outcomes of this research significantly advance the efficacy and precision of TSN network configuration detection and establish a formidable groundwork for future scholarly pursuits in this area.

AB  - With the rapid development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), massive IIoT devices connect to industrial networks via wired and wireless. Furthermore, industrial networks pose new requirements on communications, such as strict latency boundaries, ultra-reliable transmission, and so on. To this end, time-sensitive networking (TSN) embedded fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication technology (i.e., TSN-5G networks), is considered the most promising solution to address these challenges. TSN can provide deterministic end-to-end latency and reliability for real-time applications in wired networks. 5G supports ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (uRLLC), providing increased flexibility and inherent mobility support in the wireless network. Thus, the integration of TSN and 5G provides numerous benefits, including increased flexibility, lower commissioning costs, and seamless interoperability of various devices, regardless of whether they use a wired or wireless interface. Nonetheless, the potential barriers between the TSN and 5G systems, such as clock synchronization and end-to-end traffic scheduling, are inevitable. Time synchronization has been studied in many works, so this paper focuses on the end-to-end traffic scheduling problem in TSN-5G networks. We propose a novel integrated TSN and 5G industrial network architecture, where the 5G system acts as a logical TSN-capable bridge. Based on this network architecture, we design a Double Q-learning based hierarchical particle swarm optimization algorithm (DQHPSO) to search for the optimal scheduling solution. The DQHPSO algorithm adopts a level-based population structure and introduces Double Q-learning to adjust the number of levels in the population, which evades the local optimum to further improve the search efficiency. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the DQHPSO algorithm can increase the scheduling success ratio of time-triggered flows compared to other algorithms.

AB  - Various Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices and their compelling applications have witnessed exponential growth over the past few years. Compared to the consumer internet, the industrial IoT often faces tough communication latency boundaries and low packet loss. Recently, time-sensitive networks (TSN) technique has been considered the most promising solution to tackle these issues, providing deterministic communication guarantees for time-sensitive applications. In TSN, to achieve bounded low latency, it introduces the Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) mechanism to shape and regulate the transmission selection to provide the protected transmission window for time-triggered (TT) flows. Currently, a considerable amount of literature has explored traffic scheduling with the CQF mechanism in TSN. However, these methods ignore the impact of routing policy on scheduling optimization. In this paper, we design two algorithms to tackle the problem of joint routing and scheduling optimization with the CQF mechanism for TSN. We propose a TT flow sorting algorithm (JDPS) to measure the scheduling priority weight of each TT flow, which uses the normalization method to calculate the weight based on the flow's deadline, period, and size. Then, we propose a joint routing and scheduling optimization with load balance algorithm (JRS-LB) to improve the scheduling success radio and the network resource utilization, which jointly considers the injection time slot offset, scheduling, and routing of TT traffic. The evaluation results mainly focus on the scheduling success ratio, execution time, and resource utilization for the proposed algorithm compared to the Tabu and Naive algorithms. Extensive simulations indicate that the proposed JDPS and JRS-LB algorithms can improve the scheduling success radio compared with the other algorithms.

AB  - An edge-cloud collaborative intelligent (ECCI) platform is of great significance for the agile development and rapid deployment of ECCI applications, which are essential for realizing smart industry in the era of Industry 4.0. However, the existing platforms lack considering the high real-time latency demand of industrial operations, which severely hinders the development of smart industry and may even lead to severe industrial accidents. To effectively reduce the response latency of industrial applications, in this article, we propose an ECCI platform IndustEdge. It takes time-sensitive networking as the deterministic transport for the link layer, and provides an extensible ECCI orchestration component to reduce the system level latency. Furthermore, IndustEdge has an ECCI algorithm library for different collaborative modes and provides the complete life cycle management for ECCI applications. We implement platforms for both the real-world prototype and emulated-world emulation, and conduct two case studies to evaluate the effectiveness of IndustEdge.

AB  - IEEE time sensitive networks (TSN) offer redundant paths for automation networks that are essential preconditions for network load balancing (NLB) or distribution. They also provide several traffic shapers and schedulers with different impacts on the data flow control. The selection of the right traffic shaper or scheduler for an automation network is challenging. Their influence depends on various network parameters such as network extension, network cycles, application cycles, and the amount of data per traffic class and network cycle. In this study, data flow control for NLB in automation TSN using different traffic shapers and schedulers was investigated. The effects of the network parameters on the shapers and schedulers were derived and imported into the data flow control model of the automation network. The sample networks were simulated, and performance comparisons were made. The results show that the enhancements for scheduled traffic (EST), strict priority queuing (SPQ), and the combination of SPQ with frame preemption (FP) are better scheduler selections in connection with larger networks, fast network cycles, and fast application cycles. The cyclic queuing and forwarding (CQF) shaper and asynchronous traffic shaper (ATS) are rather an alternative for load control in small networks or in conjunction with slow applications.

AB  - The network architecture with the controller area network (CAN) as the domain bus in most domains and time-sensitive networking (TSN) as the backbone network is called the CAN-TSN interconnection network architecture, which has been or will be employed in industrial embedded networks (e.g., automobiles, spacecraft, and factory automation). In this architecture, the CAN-TSN gateway acts as a transmission hub handling a large number of communications between the CAN domains and TSN. However, most commercial CAN-TSN gateways are highly integrated with low flexibility, such that they are hard to accommodate different time planning mechanisms from TSN. In addition, these CAN-TSN gateways suffer from high congestion when TSN frames are sent from the TSN side to a CAN domain (i.e., TSN-to-CAN transmission) because of at least 100 times in the transmission rate between CAN and TSN. In this study, we propose a high-flexibility CAN-TSN gateway, where the CAN side can be easily adapted to different bus protocols, and the TSN side can be easily adapted to different configurations. In the gateway, we develop a low-congestion TSN-to-CAN scheduler, which executes a maximum awaiting time (MAT)-based scheduling strategy to alleviate the congestion. Experiments on the prototype platform show the advantages of the proposed CAN-TSN gateway and the developed MAT-based scheduling strategy.

AB  - In the field of transportation, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an important component of the Internet of Things. The vehicle-to-vehicle communication is particularly challenging in mobile IoV networks because they are operated in complex and highly variable environments. The mobile IoV transmission interruption level can be evaluated by the outage probability (OP) performance. If the OP performance can be analyzed and predicted accurately, the Quality of Service (QoS) in the mobile IoV networks can be improved. However, the analysis and prediction of mobile IoV transmission channels is very challenging because they are highly dynamic. In this article, the analysis and prediction of the OP performance for mobile IoV networks are investigated. A hybrid decode-amplify-forward (HDAF) relaying scheme with transmit antenna selection (TAS) is considered. The exact OP expressions are derived in a closed form, and the analytical results are verified. To realize the real-time analysis of the OP performance, an intelligent OP prediction algorithm based on the improved cuckoo search (ICS) is presented. The proposed algorithm is compared with different methods and the results show that it has a better OP prediction performance. The prediction accuracy of ICS-BP can be increased by 51.8% compared with the existing algorithms.

AB  - With the vigorous development of automobile industry, in-vehicle network is also constantly upgraded to meet data transmission requirements of emerging applications. The main transmission requirements are low latency and certainty especially for autonomous driving. Time sensitive networking (TSN) based on Ethernet gives a possible solution to these requirements. Previous surveys usually investigated TSN from a general perspective, which referred to TSN of various application fields. In this paper, we focus on the application of TSN to the in-vehicle networks. For in-vehicle networks, we discuss all related TSN standards specified by IEEE 802.1 work group up to now. We further overview and analyze recent literature on various aspects of TSN for automotive applications, including synchronization, resource reservation, scheduling, certainty, software and hardware. Application scenarios of TSN for in-vehicle networks are analyzed one by one. Since TSN of in-vehicle network is still at a very initial stage, this paper also gives insights on open issues, future research directions and possible solutions.

AB  - Industrial Internet, or Industry 4.0, has presented strict requirements for deterministic transmission capability over a shared network of multiple applications. Time-sensitive metworking (TSN) is recognized as an efficient networking solution for the features of bounded delay, low delay variation, and zero congestion loss. However, the benefits of TSN are limited to closed networks now. The interconnection of several TSN networks through non-TSN networks is a main upcoming challenge for emerging applications. This article proposes an interconnection scheme following a software-defined TSN (SD-TSN) paradigm to enable deter-ministic communications among multiple closed networks. The networks are controlled by a centralized entity with a network controller and service orchestrator for interoperability. The time synchro-nization and traffic scheduling mechanisms are designed to connect TSN and non-TSN networks. The proposed scheme is validated in a prototype testbed, and obtained results show its effectiveness in time synchronization and delay guarantees.

AB  - Deterministic transmission guarantee in time-sensitive networks (TSN) relies on queue models (such as CQF, TAS, ATS) and resource scheduling algorithms. Thanks to its ease of use, the CQF queue model has been widely adopted. However, the existing resource scheduling algorithms of CQF model only focus on periodic time-triggered (TT) flows without consideration of bursting flows. Considering that the bursting flows often carry high-priority data in real systems, in this paper we investigate the mixed-flow (i.e., TT and bursting flows) scheduling problem in CQF-based TSN aiming to maximize the number of schedulable flows and system load balance while satisfying the deterministic demands of delay, jitter, and reliability for both TT and bursting flows. Unfortunately, it is challenging to schedule the mixed flows with the original CQF model because of the huge difference between TT and bursting flows. To resolve this problem, we firstly design an enhanced Multi-CQF model to satisfy the basic demands of bursting flows sent at any time without affecting the deterministic transmission of TT flows. Given the complexity of mixed-flow scheduling and the proposed queue model, it is difficult for traditional algorithms to fully utilize network resources. Thus, we further propose a uline time-correlated uline DRL uline resource uline scheduling (TimeDRS) algorithm to optimize the resource allocation. TimeDRS can be extended to other time-related resource scheduling scenarios, such as TDMA-based scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approaches can greatly reduce frame loss and end-to-end latency for bursting flows, and well balance runtime and schedulability compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) can help standardize deterministic Ethernet across industrial automation. The deterministic guarantee of TSN is based on network resource scheduling in the unit of flow. However, the state-of-the-art TSN single flow scheduling scheme cannot meet the coordinated scheduling requirements of multiple data flows in advanced industrial applications (e.g., control and safety applications). In this article, we propose a TSN chain flow abstraction, TC-Flow, for a coordinated multiple-flow scheduling model in industrial control and safety applications. Based on the proposed TC-Flow model, we design an offline TC-Flow scheduling algorithm using integer linear programming and an online heuristic TC-Flow scheduling algorithm to handle network dynamics. To deploy the proposed TC-Flow model and scheduling algorithms in the TSN, we design a CF-TSN network architecture that is compatible with the existing TSN single-flow scheduling scheme. Finally, we implement the proposed CF-TSN architecture and TC-Flow scheduling algorithms in real-world network environments. Experimental results show that the proposed scheduling algorithms can increase the number of schedulable flows by 26 percent compared to the state-of-the-art TSN scheduling benchmark.

AB  - In this paper, we present a three-layer (i.e., device, field, and factory layers) deterministic federated learning (FL) framework, named DetFed, which accelerates collaborative learning process for ultra-reliable and low-latency industrial Internet of Things (IoT) via integrating 6G-oriented Time-sensitive Networks (TSN). Utilizing dispersive local data, industrial IoT devices distributively train a deep neural network (DNN) model, and the updated model parameters are aggregated at their associated field servers every round or at a centralized factory server every a few rounds. Aiming at optimizing the learning accuracy of FL without affecting the co-transmission of burst traffic (e.g., safety-critical traffic), an integrated TSN is considered to establish connections among the three layers, where a cyclic queuing and forwarding mechanism is deployed in each switch to support deterministic model parameter transmission with microsecond-level delay and near-zero packet loss requirements. To improve the FL performance, we formulate a multi-objective stochastic optimization problem to simultaneously maximize the scheduling success ratio and learning accuracy while satisfying the deterministic requirements of delay, jitter, and packet loss. Since the objective function is implicit and the available time slots of the considered TSN in each FL round are temporally correlated, the problem is difficult to solve in real time. Therefore, we transform the problem into a Markov decision process formulation and propose a dynamic resource scheduling algorithm, based on deep reinforcement learning, to make optimal resource scheduling decisions while adapting to device heterogeneity and network dynamics. Experimental results based on real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed DetFed significantly accelerates FL convergence and improves learning accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.

AB  - The growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices brings enormous time-sensitive applications, which require real-time transmission to effectuate communication services. The ultrareliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) scenario in the fifth generation (5G) has played a critical role in supporting services with delay-sensitive properties. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) has been widely considered as a promising paradigm for enabling the deterministic transmission guarantees for 5G. However, TSN is a hybrid traffic system with time-sensitive traffic and best effort traffic, which require effective routing and scheduling to provide a deterministic and bounded delay. While joint optimization of time-sensitive and non-time-sensitive traffic greatly increases the solution space and brings a significant challenge to obtain solutions. Therefore, this article proposes a graph convolutional network-based deep reinforcement learning (GCN-based DRL) solution for the joint optimization problem in practical communication scenarios. The GCN is integrated into deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to obtain the network’s spatial dependence and elevate the generalization performance of the proposed method. Specifically, the GCN adopts the first-order Chebyshev polynomial to approximate the graph convolution kernel, which reduces the complexity of the algorithm and improves the feasibility for the joint optimization task. Furthermore, priority experience replay is employed to accelerate the convergence speed of the model training process. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed GCN-based DRL algorithm has good convergence and outperforms the benchmark methods in terms of the average end-to-end delay.

AB  - Traditionally, industrial networks rely on field bus to support real-time applications. In the trend of industrial internet of things (IIoT), traffic load has increased dramatically, and industrial networks are moving towards time-sensitive networking (TSN), which is based on the widely used Ethernet. In TSN, the time-triggered mechanism is a promising technology for real-time control due to its ability to provide deterministic latency and jitter guarantees. However, this mechanism is mainly based on offline computed schedules, making it difficult to satisfy dynamic requirements in data transmission of IIoT. In this paper, we propose an adaptive group routing and scheduling (AGRS) approach in multicast time-sensitive networks. The framework of this approach contains three phases including pre-processing, schedule synthesis, and post-processing phases. While the pre-processing phase first prunes unnecessary links and adaptively groups qualified complete subgraphs of the network to obtain a simplified topology, the schedule synthesis phase then jointly considers routing and scheduling processes based on the simplified topology to improve schedulability. Finally, the post-processing phase handles the scheduling results of previous phases to generate a feasible schedule. Experiments show that our approach improves schedulability by 68% and reduces execution time by 74% for multicast time-sensitive networks compared with existing approaches.

AB  - With the development of hardware virtualization and cloud computing, modern industry has a tendency to upgrade from the traditional industrial networks to virtual machine (VM) based networks. To provide firm latency guarantees for control messages in these networks, the time-sensitive network (TSN) is a promising technology due to its determinacy for real-time applications. However, TSN faces the challenge of providing a rapid response to dynamic transmission requirement changes incurred by VM migrations. In this paper, we proposed an online scheduling approach to deal with dynamic VM migrations in multicast TSN. In this approach, we devise a novel online scheduling framework [minimal distance tree (MDT) construction - heuristic breadth first search] containing an offline scheduling phase and an online rescheduling phase. While the offline phase introduces a MDT to increase reusable scheduling results, the online phase proposes a heuristic scheduling approach to reuse the results of the offline phase as much as possible to accelerate the rescheduling process. Experiments show that our framework can provide a rapid response to dynamic VM migrations compared with the existing approaches where the amount of control data does not exceed 50% of the bandwidth.

AB  - With the advent of Industry 4.0 and the popularization of smart terminal equipment, the interaction between industrial field information systems and production equipment has intensified. To meet the real-time transmission of time-triggered flow and the coordinated transmission of best effort flow, time-sensitive network-related technologies are used to implement flow queue forwarding by strictly following the gate control list. First, response-time analysis method is proposed to predict the upper bound of delay under a scheduling model following IEEE 802.1Qbv. Second, according to response-time analysis, a deadline monotonic scheduling algorithm with temporary priority expansion is proposed to divide the priority into more levels, which is not limited by the queue type, so as to ameliorate the transmission sequence of switch export flow. Finally, an adaptive priority adjustment scheduling algorithm with temporary priority expansion is designed to construct the optimal scheduling method further improving the scheduling success rate and reducing worst-case end-to-end delays. Compared with similar algorithms, the algorithm proposed improves the scheduling success rate by at least 30%, reduces the total delay by at least 21% and the TT flow delay by 11% in high network utilization conditions.

AB  - With the advent of Industry 4.0 and the popularization of smart terminal equipment, the interaction between industrial field information systems and production equipment has intensified. To meet the real-time transmission of time-triggered flow and the coordinated transmission of best effort flow, time-sensitive network-related technologies are used to implement flow queue forwarding by strictly following the gate control list. First, response-time analysis method is proposed to predict the upper bound of delay under a scheduling model following IEEE 802.1Qbv. Second, according to response-time analysis, a deadline monotonic scheduling algorithm with temporary priority expansion is proposed to divide the priority into more levels, which is not limited by the queue type, so as to ameliorate the transmission sequence of switch export flow. Finally, an adaptive priority adjustment scheduling algorithm with temporary priority expansion is designed to construct the optimal scheduling method further improving the scheduling success rate and reducing worst-case end-to-end delays. Compared with similar algorithms, the algorithm proposed improves the scheduling success rate by at least 30%, reduces the total delay by at least 21% and the TT flow delay by 11% in high network utilization conditions.

AB  - Vehicle time-sensitive communication (VTSC) is an emerging paradigm where the Time-Sensitive Networking together with V2X provides connected vehicle with deterministic and low communication latency. Scheduling is a critical step to realize the determinism. Recently, as the scale and variety of VTSCs increase, the requirements of simultaneously achieve multicast supportment, short runtime, dynamic schduling ability and low resource overhead challenge the traditional TSN scheduling algorithms. This article proposes a scheduling scheme with multiple stages to achieve both efficient and rapid scheduling. This article first formulates the joint routing and scheduling problems by proposing a cluster-Integer Linear Programming (CILP). It aims to accelerate the static scheduling and realize real-time response for dynamic incremental scheduling. An improved topology pruning method and a clustering-aggregation ILP procedure are presented. Then, since the dynamic scheduling will gradually reduce the resource utilization, this article proposes an adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) to rapidly perform the resource optimization. The crossover operator, mutation operator, adaptive probability and fitness function are designed, supporting multicast TSN flows. Finally, this article conducts extensive simulations to validate the proposed algorithms. The results show that, comparing with traditional methods, the proposed CILP method can reduce the average runtime by up to 86.7% for static scheduling and realize real-time dynamic scheduling. The proposed AGA method can reduce the resource optimization runtime by up to 70% while improving the schedulability. The overall multi-stage scheduling mechanism could satisfy the VTSC scheduling requirements.

AB  - The growing popularity of intelligent manufacturing is driven by deterministic transmission demands of applications in industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS). However, the ossified shortages of industrial wireless communication such as diverse quality of service (QoS) and complex signaling processes incur a severe long tail of transmission delay distribution. As a solution, the 5th generation (5G) wireless communication technology provides ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) for industry scenarios. Moreover, the newly proposed time-sensitive networking (TSN) standards guarantee the transmission determinacy by gate mechanism. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous time-sensitive network (HTSN) co-designed by 5G and TSN. We first develop a predictive multi-priority wireless scheduling mechanism based on semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) to reduce signaling delay by reserving resources in advance. Then we propose an adaptive data injection mechanism for TSN based on per-stream filtering and policing (PSFP), which dynamically adjusts the priority of data for queue injection in TSN. To further reduce the long tail of delay, we employ a risk-sensitive learning method to improve the worst-case delay. Simulations on a hot rolling production scenario demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms under HTSN achieve great performance in terms of integrated delay and resource utilization.

AB  - With the increase in the number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and future requirements for vehicle functions, two SR (Stream Reservation) traffic classes may not be sufficient to ensure fulfilment of constraints for multiple traffic types with individual timing requirements transmitted in the Ethernet-AVB (Audio Video Bridging) networks. The goal of this paper is to determine the worst-case delay for an additional SR traffic class under the CBS (Credit-Based Shaper) algorithm. Delay evaluation is based on the impact analysis of CBS on different priority flows, particularly depending on when the credits of both SR class A and B drain from the worst-case perspective. More specifically, both the impact of CBS and the evolution trends of credit on different priority class flows are first analyzed from the worst-case perspective. Then, for an additional SR class, two types of worst-case delay models are established with the CBS configuration suggestions. Finally, an approach to calculate the worst-case queuing delay is proposed. Moreover, the worst-case end-to-end delay is determined by the network calculus approach and simulation. Numerical results show that the delay bounds of our models are tighter than those of other models, which is beneficial to the development of Ethernet-AVB for in-vehicle networking.

AB  - Distributed safety-critical applications in industrial automation, aerospace, and automotive, require worst-case end-to-end latency analysis for critical communication flows in order to prove their correct behavior in the temporal domain. With the advent of time sensitive networks (TSNs), distributed applications can be built on top of standard Ethernet technologies without sacrificing real-time characteristics. The time-based transmission selection and clock synchronization mechanism defined in the TSN enable the real-time transmission of frames based on a global schedule configured through so-called gate control lists (GCLs). This paper has an enhancement of allowing a mixture of the priority-based scheduling and time-triggered, which expand the solution space for the GCLs. Then, it is necessary to analyze the latency bounds for the critical traffic in the TSN network. In this paper, we start from the assumption that the GCLs, i.e., the communication schedules, and the traffic class (priority) assignment for critical flows are given for each output port and derive, using network calculus, an analysis of the worst-case delays that individual critical flows can experience along the hops from sender to receiver(s). Our method can be employed for the analysis of the TSNs where the GCLs have been created in advance, as well as for driving the GCL synthesis that explores a larger solution space than previous methods, which required a complete isolation of transmission events from different traffic classes. We validate our model and analysis by performing experiments on both synthetic and real-world use-cases, showing the scalability of our implementation as well as the impact of certain GCL properties (gate overlapping and traffic class assignments) on the worst-case latency of critical communication flows.

Then, it is necessary to analyze the latency bounds for the critical traffic in the TSN network. In this paper, we start from the assumption that the GCLs, i.e., the communication schedules, and the traffic class (priority) assignment for critical flows are given for each output port and derive, using network calculus, an analysis of the worst-case delays that individual critical flows can experience along the hops from sender to receiver(s). Our method can be employed for the analysis of the TSNs where the GCLs have been created in advance, as well as for driving the GCL synthesis that explores a larger solution space than previous methods, which required a complete isolation of transmission events from different traffic classes. We validate our model and analysis by performing experiments on both synthetic and real-world use-cases, showing the scalability of our implementation as well as the impact of certain GCL properties (gate overlapping and traffic class assignments) on the worst-case latency of critical communication flows.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is an upcoming set of Ethernet standards designed for real-time and safety-critical Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications in automotive, aerospace, and industrial automation domains. With the combination, complexity, and flexibility of flow control mechanisms in TSN connected systems, the performance analysis for mixed-critical messages is becoming a difficult challenge. The flexible window-based gate control list (GCL) scheduling model has been proposed as a relaxation to assumptions on frames-to-window allocation, mutually exclusive gates opening, and scheduled end systems and switches, which offers more flexibility in the configuration of GCLs. In this article, we are interested in providing a reliable verification method based on the network calculus theory to drive GCL configurations for TSN networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first performance analysis method suitable for the general flexible window-based GCLs in entire TSN networks, by reflecting the relative positional relationships of windows for same priority queues on consecutive nodes and constructing the window limitations into the shaper curve, in order to reduce the pessimism of the latency bounds. We validate the proposed method through Industrial IoT synthetics test cases and two large realistic cases, showing the significant reduction in pessimism on delay bounds, and the correctness and scalability by comparing with results from the previous work and simulation results.

AB  - Owning to the sub-standards being developed by IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group, the traditional IEEE 802.1 Ethernet is enhanced to support real-time dependable communications for future time- and safety-critical applications. Several sub-standards have been recently proposed that introduce various traffic shapers (e.g., Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), Asynchronous Traffic Shaper (ATS), Credit-Based Shaper (CBS), Strict Priority (SP)) for flow control mechanisms of queuing and scheduling, targeting different application requirements. These shapers can be used in isolation or combination and there is limited work that analyzes, evaluates, and compares their performance, which makes it challenging for end-users to choose the right combination for their applications. This paper aims at (i) quantitatively comparing various traffic shapers and their combinations, (ii) summarizing, classifying, and extending the architectures of individual and combined traffic shapers and their Network calculus (NC)-based performance analysis methods, and (iii) filling the gap in the timing analysis research on handling ATS and CBS used for different priority queues, and two novel hybrid architectures of combined traffic shapers, i.e., TAS+ATS+SP and TAS+ATS+CBS when ATS and CBS used at the same queue. A large number of experiments, using both synthetic and realistic test cases, are carried out for quantitative performance comparisons of various individual and combined traffic shapers, from the perspective of upper bounds of delay, backlog, and jitter. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to quantitatively compare the performance of the main traffic shapers in TSN. The paper aims at supporting the researchers and practitioners in the selection of suitable TSN sub-protocols for their use cases.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a set of amendments that extend Ethernet to support distributed safety-critical and real-time applications in the industrial automation, aerospace, and automotive areas. TSN integrates multiple traffic types and supports interactions in several combinations. In this article, we consider the configuration supporting scheduled traffic (ST) based on gate-control lists, audio–video bridging (AVB) traffic according to IEEE 802.1BA that has bounded latencies, and best-effort traffic, for which no guarantees are provided. This article extends the timing analysis method to multiple AVB classes and proofs the credit bounds for multiple classes of AVB traffic, respectively, under frozen and nonfrozen behaviors of credit during guard band (GB). They are prerequisites for nonoverflow credits of credit-based shaper (CBS) and preventing starvation of AVB traffic. Moreover, this article proposes an improved timing analysis method reducing the pessimism for the worst-case end-to-end delays of AVB traffic by considering the limitations from the physical link rate and the output of CBS. Finally, we evaluate the improved analysis method on both synthetic and real-world test cases, showing the significant reduction of pessimism on latency bounds compared to related work and presenting the correctness validation compared with simulation results. We also compare the AVB latency bounds in the case of frozen and nonfrozen credit during GB. Additionally, we evaluate the scalability of our method with variation of the load of ST flows and of the bandwidth reservation for AVB traffic.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) has emerged as a promising standard for real-time domains. Efficiently determining critical configuration parameters for latency guarantees for time-critical flows remains an open question. Current configuration approaches rely on optimization methods with real-time performance analysis feedback to ensure deadline quality-of-service requirements. However, the ex-post verification-based optimization methods require exhaustive traversal of the entire network search space, leading to significant time consumption. This article proposes a novel, fast, and scalable deadline-aware method for configuring minimum bandwidth allocation for stream reservation (SR) classes in the TSN network, while guaranteeing deadline requirements for all time-critical traffic. We provide formal proof of our approach, which configures critical parameters in a real-time network with prior performance guarantees, thus reducing computational complexity. The analytical method is evaluated on synthetic cases, comparing it with state-of-the-art solutions to demonstrate validity and correctness. Moreover, an adapted real-world case shows the method's scalability, and minimum bandwidth reservations with guaranteed local deadlines for SR classes on all egress ports of the network can be achieved in seconds.

AB  - The IEEE 802.1Qbv standard schedules time-triggered (TT) flows (i.e., period flows) in a fixed TT Window each period. However,period flows generated by non-deterministic end systems exhibit significant jitter, whichleads to a mismatch between the generation times and the scheduled TT Windows. In the worst case scenario, this mismatch can cause an additional send delay of approximately one period in the flow. In this study,we model the send delay issue due to the maximum send delay requirement for all frames in a period flow not being satisfied simultaneously, and measure the jitter of period flows in a typical non-deterministic end system. Moreover, we propose an access mechanism for jittered period flows to schedule multiple conflict-free TT Windows in each period of flows at the source end system and control the send delay within the required delay tolerance. This mechanism enables deterministic access to jittered period flows, providing a prerequisite for reliable end-to-end transmission in the network. Moreover, this mechanism adopts a multi-objective integer linear programming (MILP) solver to optimize the TT Windows schedule. Furthermore, we establish the constraints and objective functions for the MILP solver and evaluate the mechanism with actual sampled frames in a real non-deterministic end system. Compared with the conventional fixed single TT Window and worst-case delay analysis mechanisms, the proposed mechanism satisfies the send delay requirements and considerably reduces the buffer usage at the source end system.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) has great potential as an airborne network to interconnect modules in integrated modular avionics (IMA) system. For TSN-based IMA system, the hybrid scheduling of processing in modules and communication in TSN can guarantee its real-time performance. However, traditional task-message scheduling methods still lack applicability and scalability due to their incompatibility with the partition-task hierarchical architecture in modules and high complexity brought by the tight coupling of tasks and messages. Partition-message scheduling methods can ensure this applicability and scalability, but cannot coordinate tasks with messages well, thus sacrificing real-time guarantee capabilities. Namely, existing methods cannot comprehensively ensure the scheduling performance, including applicability, real-time, and scalability. Therefore, we propose a novel loosely coupled partition-(task)-message scheduling framework. It takes partitions and messages as scheduling objects and uses tasks as their coordination medium, to overcome the dependencies of existing methods on time-triggered tasks and guarantee applicability. Besides, it can also enhance real-time performance by analyzing task execution boundaries and application-layer end-to-end delays, and improve scalability through parallel optimizing and the incremental solving with block identification and adaptive adjustment. Experiments validate that it can schedule complex systems with up to 150 partitions, 1000 tasks, and 600 messages. Compared with the existing methods, it can accelerate the solving speed by 41% and reduce end-to-end delays by 27%.

AB  - Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), which evolves from the Ethernet standards, has been developed to ensure deterministic transmission in data networks. Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS) extends the conventional synchronized TSN with an asynchronous scheduler to guarantee a bounded transmitting delay. In this work, we present a Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) implementation of a TSN scheduling entity, which leverages ATS for the frame forwarding process. We explore the ATS design by function blocks and compare it with a benchmark design utilizing strict-priority scheduling. In terms of operating frequency, our results indicate that strict-priority scheduling performs 1.05% to 9.56% higher maximum frequency than ATS with the same configurations. Regarding resource utilization, ATS consumes 51% to 119% more logic blocks and 51% to 101% more registers than strict-priority scheduling. Based on the synthesis and fitting results from Register-Transfer Level (RTL) simulations, we provide a general vision of designing and implementing considerations of the ATS function. Specifically, we show the influences of the buffer and bus width configuration on the FPGA implementation scale and data rate.

AB  - Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is being widely investigated to provide Ethernet capabilities for in-vehicle backbone communication. However, the gate control list (GCL), as a simple mechanism for achieving timing determinism for safety-critical traffic (ST) frames with hard deadlines, is too rigid to handle the intrinsic timing uncertainty of automated driving systems (ADSs). Due to the complexity and the unpredictable operating environment, there can be delayed ST frames that can disrupt the solidly fixed timing behavior. In this work, we present one novel approach to effectively use bandwidth resources to deal with delayed ST frames, which cannot be handled by a traditional fixed GCL, and the discarding of them should be reduced to improve the system’s integrity. An acceptance test is implemented to report to the application layer when an ST frame will miss its deadline and hence be rejected, i.e., prevented from entering the switch. To further improve the efficiency of bandwidth usage, we investigate how to improve the performance of the more important Class A frames in an audio-video-bridging (AVB) switch, which adopts a credit-based shaper mechanism, and we propose a constant bandwidth server to replace the credit-based shaper while taking fairness into consideration. Evaluation with extensive experiments shows that both resilience and efficiency of the TSN are significantly enhanced compared with a credit-based shaper, especially when the traffic load is relatively high. For the delayed ST frames and event-triggered traffic, our approach is able to schedule more than the solution using the AVB switch even with a high network load.
